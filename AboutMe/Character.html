    I like to party. My way of partying is shared with a lot of other Swedes - 
    to drink alcohol together with lots of friends. After a while, I normally 
    want to go out to dance. For some reason I find that fun to do, but I have 
    trouble doing this when I am sober (or almost sober).<br>
    <br>
    I learned to dance Hip-hop when I was 21, on a dancing school in Växjö. I 
    was by far the oldest one in my class, but I found it to be fun. I quit 
    after finding our that the next step would be to practice the steps so be 
    able to compete in some small tournaments. I figured that I have reached my 
    goal then, and I was finally able to go out and dance on discos, without 
    feeling nervous for it. That's right - I had only been to one &quot;real&quot; disco 
    before that, and that was just before transferring to the University of 
    Växjö. This course really helped my self confidence.<br>
    Pretty similar to the improvement of my self confidence that my Ju-jitsu 
    training did for me. I got my black belt in May 1990. These 2 together 
    helped to shape the person I am today. <br>
    After my black belt in Ju-jitsu, I took orange or green belt in Judo. I won 
    a few small contests in Judo, but this was not my thing. Too much 
    competition. I enjoyed throwing people around though. <br>
    <br>
    Taking pictures with my camera, is also something I enjoy. Perhaps I will 
    buy a digital camera one day, when the price is right for a camera that can 
    produce 3000x2000 pixels. This camera should also be able to use my current 
    lenses.<p>I don't like to drive cars, but for some reason I like to drive my 
    motorcycle. In 1999, I really wanted to buy a blue Yamaha YZF R1.<p>These days I usually wear Boss Elements, which I buy at Kastrup (Copenhagen 
    Airport). A friend of mine asked me one day which perfume I was using, and I 
    did not realize that I smell that much. After a while we came to the 
    conclusion that it might be the perfume itself has a very strong fragrance. 
    That's what friends are for, make you realize things about yourself that 
    only they can tell you. </td>
