    <p>Once upon a time there was a tiny IP-address called 192.71.126.154. But 
    she was so tiny and cute that all of her friends just called her Pingeling. 
    Whenever they wanted to make a joke about her name they called her ICMP II 
    Echo Request.<br>
    <br>
    One day she was running around in the big net. Happy to get an invitation 
    from 185.24.243.172 (that she always referred to as her &quot;big 
    hundredeightyfive twentyfour friend&quot;) she wanted to go to his party that he 
    was having in a buffer somewhere. After traveling a while, she came cross a 
    big nasty Router. The bad router did not want to let her through to the 
    other interface. Sad, she sat down on a lost packet and tried to find a way 
    to get to her friend.<br>
    <br>
    Then she got an idea. What if she timed out, then perhaps another router 
    would help her find her way. So she timed out.<br>
    <br>
    Then she found a lot of friendly routers that wanted to help her on her way. 
    She promised to come visit them after she had been to the party. Finally she 
    arrived at his party, and it was a great party. They danced and talked about 
    the clever IP version 6 that had joined them. He told then about the new 
    world opening, and about the BFR (Cisco 12000) he had chatted with on his 
    way here. They promised to meet here again in one month.<br>
