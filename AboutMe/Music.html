    <p>My favourite group is
    <a target="_self" href="http://ubl.artistdirect.com/music/artist/card/0,,537333,00.html?src=redirsearch&artist=La+Bouche">La Bouche</a>. I try to get all their songs, and all possible re-mixes, on 
    CD (or on mp3). <br>
    Another group that I listen a lot to is Basic Element. <br>
    Mostly I listen to Euro-disco, which is sort of like club-music or Techno.<br>
    <br>
    I tend to try and listen to music constantly at home. As soon as I get home 
    from work, I turn on either the stereo, or the computer or both.<br>
    <br>
    You could say that I'm a slave under the top dance-charts, and I wouldn't 
    call you a liar. I might in fact agree with you. The kind of music they play 
    at the dance charts in Sweden is the kind of music I listen to. But there's 
    only room for a certain amount of music on the charts. So I, like everyone 
    else, have to find my music somewhere else too. I download a lot of 
    Euro-dance, and generally they where produced around 1997 +-5 years. </td>
