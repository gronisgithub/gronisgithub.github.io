    <p>I like to play games at my PC, and that is one of the most frequent 
    activities. Other activities are 3D rendering, photo manipulation, and mixing music.<br>
    <br>
    I'm extremely picky about hardware when it comes to serious gaming. Most of 
    my friends would certainly agree with this. This means I spend a lot of 
    money on fast graphics-card and so on. I have trouble seeing the detail 
    level as other people see, so I go for speed instead. I want my games to 
    react quick to my movements with the joystick and mouse. <br>
    <br>
    My 3D rendering period started at the university. I found a program called 
    vivid. This was a primitive program that you had to actually program to get 
    it to render any image.<br>
    The programming language resembles very much to Turbo Pascal and C. You 
    could not create holes in the surfaces, you could only add surfaces in it. 
    At least I think so. I never found any commands of how to remove a section 
    of any object.<br>
    To make a &quot;preview&quot; you rendered the entire image, in a smaller scale. This 
    was back in the days when Intel's 80486 was the fastest one. It took around 
    5 hours for my huge images (1024x768) to render. I had at most 20 objects 
    (spheres, boxes).... Those where the days. After creating the output file, 
    you had to convert it to .gif. Ray tracing in 256 colors was great back 
    then. <br>
    <br>
    Back in those days, I normally listened to Laser Dance when creating the 
    images. <br>
    <br>
    I've always been interested in sound on the computer. My first file that I 
    ever sampled was KLFs &quot;3 AM Eternal&quot;. I sampled this through the 
    SoundBlaster PRO, which had stereo. It got 5 floppy disks big. Right now my 
    music files are a little bit more advanced.... <br>
    <br>
    The type of games I play are normally racing games. To give you an example. 
    MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix 1, I completed at the hardest level. There 
    where more than 12 races, and I drove on the hardest level, full race 
    length. Each race took then more than 2 hours. If I didn't win I had to race 
    the track again. Needless to say, this took some time to complete. <br>
    Some of the good games are: Quake III Arena, Rally Masters, STCC 2.
    <p><span lang="sv">Most fun is to play racing (car/bike) and shooting games 
    (Quake III Team Arena) in a network with many people in one house.</span><br>
