    <p>Movies are a big part of my life (but becoming less and less important).<br>
    Since the release of DVD, I've become a big fan of collecting DVD movies. 
    The pirate-DVDs in China are very cheap, so I bought a lot of them when I 
    was there. Enough to fill one suite case, all by them selves. Now you see 
    how much I used to like to watch movies.<br>
    It really helps me to keep my English alive. Whenever possible I watch the 
    movie without any subtitles to get the true feeling of the movies, the way 
    it was intended to be seen.<br>
    <br>
    In surround sound, and DVD quality gives you a good impression of how 
    serious my movie watching is.<br>

    My favorite movie is

    Leon</a> (The Professional in the US).&nbsp;<br>
    The movie I've seen the most times is the
    <a target="_self" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000K3D4/qid=939427442/s%20r=1-2/002-0024290-6100222">
    Labyrinth</a>. I've seen this one just over 100 times. Needless to say, I 
    have it on DVD and VHS.<br>
    Some summer nights I've spent watching 2-3 movies every single night. This 
    was mostly when I was living with my grandparents for some weeks. After 
    work, there is only this many things you can do, so I had time to develop my 
    interest for movies. </td>
