    <p>I like to travel to lots of different places. One of the places I would 
    love to go is to the far northern part of Sweden in winter to see the 
    northern lights.<br>
    <br>
    To continue on the northern theme. Svalbard on Greenland at winter/spring to 
    watch these magnificent polar bears. In the local language the name &quot;Polar 
    bear&quot; is directly translated to the &quot;eternal walker&quot;. As the name, the polar 
    bear almost never stays at the same place. They have to keep moving to find 
    food. Needless to say, the polar bear covers great distances every day, more 
    than any man ever could.<br>
    Imagine my feelings when I saw that they have polar bears at zoos. The bears 
    cant roam around in the open like they use to. They have to stay in that 
    cage for many years at least.<br>
    The eternal walker locked in a cage. Just like a convict. Which crime did 
    these bears commit?<br>
    <br>
    After going to the Antarctica, I have trouble finding another place that I 
    would like to visit. Perhaps Galapagos.<br>
