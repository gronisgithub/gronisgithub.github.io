    Born in 1973, and a complete computer nerd, that likes to travel, take 
    photos, and drive my motorcycle. <br>

    Definition of nerd: A person that uses a tool, for the soul purpose of using 
    the tool. E.g. A telephone-nerd does not care about the person at the other 
    end of the phone, but is only interested to use the phone in all possible 
    ways. <br>

    I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.cocacola.com/">Coca Cola</a>, so if you 
    have anything to send me regarding Coca Cola, then please do.
    <a href="mailto:jonas.lewin@telia.com">Electronically</a>, or the old 
    fashioned way, just as long as you can send it to me. <br>

    As some of you know, I'm a real cookie monster. No special preferences, as 
    long as they are sweet. The problem is that as I start, I have trouble 
    quitting before the can is empty. But that's the way cookie monsters are...

    My length is 182 cm, and I usually weigh 72-76 kg. Since I spend a lot of time 
    in the sun during summers, I tend to catch more rays that others. This means 
    that people tells me that I have easier to get a suntan than most people. I 
    can agree to some extent on this, but mostly it's because I spend a lot of 
    time away from the shadows. <br>
