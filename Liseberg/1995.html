    a short introduction about my friends back in Kristianstad. We went to 
    Liseberg in summer -95. Here's every one that went to Liseberg this time. 
    Can you figure out which guy thinks he's the coolest, hardest and meanest? 
    Strangely enough, we could not fit everyone to one car in the Flumride, as 
    much as we tried :-)<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="1995,Flumride.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="309">As 
    you can see, it's possible to fit five adults and one teenager in the seats 
    of this attraction (called The Flumride). It's a bit tight, but that makes 
    it all the more fun. The more weight you put into it, the faster it runs, 
    and the harder it is to stop the carriage. Since it's hard for the water so 
    stop us quickly, the water will wash over us instead, making you soaking 
    wet. We also soaked the people around the cart, to their surprise. The 
    people on the picture is me (taking the picture), Patrik (the guy looking at 
    the camera), Jimmy, Uffe, Åsa and Steken.<br clear="all">

    can be fun. No matter how old you are, there's always some attraction that 
    that you can enjoy.</td>
