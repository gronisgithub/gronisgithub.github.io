    you might have read on this page before, I said that I wanted to buy an R1. 
    So I did. Simply because of the looks. And it does look cool to me. However, 
    some of my friends still thinks that the old bike looks better. <br>
    <br>
    Well, I'm satisfied the looks of it, and that's all that matters.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="R1Rf600Back.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="323">It's 
    amazing how big difference there is to the old one. After driving the new 
    one for a while, the old one seemed not to move at all. To give you the 
    details so you may understand a little bit better. The old had a 
    horsepower/kg value of around 0.5 hp/kg. The new one has 0.98 hp/kg. Do you 
    agree with me that the new one is moving when you use the throttle?<br clear="all">
