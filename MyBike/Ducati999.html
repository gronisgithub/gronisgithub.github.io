    or not. I decided To buy one last bike. The Ducati 999.</p>
    <p>
    It's expensive, It's good looking, and it's not that fast as the R1. If it 
    would have been as comfortable as the R1, it would be the bike of my dreams.<br clear="all">

    had a red bike, so I didn't want that.</p>
