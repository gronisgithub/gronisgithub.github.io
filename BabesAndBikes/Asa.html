    just cant get enough of rinding the bike. She even likes riding the bike on 
    the freeway, which is not one of my favourites. And she is riding with a 
    constant smile on her face (clearly visible on this picture).<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="AsaCastle9925.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="294">On 
    our first trip, we went all across Skåne, just stopping a few kilometers 
    from the east coast due to bad weather. We saw 2 mooses during another trip, 
    and so far I think that we have seen just about all types of weather and 
    road-conditions.<p>We still have some nice roads left before we have to 
    drive the same roads again. Perhaps next summer.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="AsaTryingItOut9916.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">The 
    leathersuite is quite large for her, which in turn means that she is quite 
    light to have behind me. I really enjoy driving with her, as long as the 
    weather is good.</p>
    <p>She even likes to drive straight and really fast, to feel and hear the 
    wind. Probably like me, when I was new to bikes.</p>
    <p>We both agree that curvy roads are still the best (as seen on the top 
    picture).<br clear="all">
