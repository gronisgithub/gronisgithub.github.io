    woman really has patience.<br>
    We went all the way from the east coast to the west coast, and back. Only 
    short breaks, so she could smoke, and stretch her legs and her back. That day 
    (summer '99), the weather was perfect. Only a few white clouds, and not too 
    cold. She is the smallest and the lightest person ever to take a ride with 
    me. The bikes handles very well when she is on the back seat. Of course the 
    bike handles different when she is on, compared to no passenger at all, but 
    the difference is marginal.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="MikelaCastle.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="304">This 
    woman is one of the few people, ever to ride with me on the yearly get 
    together in Kristianstad. The event draws thousands of bikers every year. 
    The time from the first biker starts off till the last one starts off, are 
    more than 2 hours. So you can imagine that the trail of bikes is quite long.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="MikelaR1CastleBehind.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="311">Every 
    summer I'm looking forward to take her for a ride. I like to take passengers 
    on my bike, especially women that have never, or almost never, tried it 
    before. She had taken a ride on a custom bike before, but she felt that this 
    was completely different. This was the way you should ride bikes.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="MikelaR1CastleFront.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="326">As 
    you may have noticed, she is one of the few people ever to ride both my 
    bikes. Only 2 people have done this so far. Her comments about the new bike 
    was that she sat higher on this one, and got more pain in the back. It was 
    also a little bit faster. My comment about this is that she had grown, and 
    so had my bike. This time we took a little bit shorter trip. Unfortunately 
    we did not find as great roads as I wanted. Better luck next time.</td>
