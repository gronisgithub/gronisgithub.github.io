    beautiful colleague. Blond long hair looks great on these pictures.<br>
    She has taken a few trips with me (first one in '98). Mostly we have been 
    close to Helsingborg, driving along the west coast of southern Sweden. I 
    will probably never see here again, since she moved to Moscow.<br clear="all">

    told me that she really enjoyed riding with me, but it's painful for the 
    neck after only a little while. I agree with her, since I also get muscle 
    ache in my neck the first times I take my bike for a spin after the winter.
