China, Beijing, The Great Wall close to Si Ma Tai, 2001-08</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="795" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">

    <p>Last time I visited Ba Da Ling, and it was packed of tourists. This part 
    of the wall is so much better, and you can climb a lot more. For those that 
    doesn't want to climb, there is a shortcut that costs some money. But for us 
    that really want to experience, you have a 2-3 hour climb, and ½-1 hour back 
    down.<br>

    <p>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-1.jpg" align="left" width="450">Let's 
    start our walk to see as much as we can of The Great Wall, here close to Si 
    Ma Tai. We start of at the base of a lake.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-2.jpg" width="450" align="left">I 
    can see The Great Wall on the top here. Some walk we have to do.</p>
    <p>
    And for every group of tourists, a Chinese person will accompany you. They 
    will sell Water (which will come in handy), or many useless stuff. When you 
    come up higher, you will find some other places where they sell water. It's 
    cheaper to buy them at the tourist shops at the base. But, then you will 
    have to carry the water for quite a while.</p>
    <p>
    You will need lots of water.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-3.jpg" width="450" align="left">The 
    Great Wall is disappearing in the mist.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-4.jpg" width="450" align="left">It's 
    HUGE. I can't really understand that it stretches all the way to Ba Da Ling. 
    And that's only a small part of it.</p>
    <p>
    It is truly the only wonder of the world, still standing.<br clear="all">
    &nbsp;<br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-5.jpg" width="450" align="left">A 
    nice part of the wall. And it just goes up, up, and up.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-6.jpg" width="450" align="left">Hey, 
    it goes down for a short while. Very scenic part of the wall. <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-7.jpg" width="450" align="left">If 
    you remember the lake from the first picture, then you can get an impression 
    of the walk you have to make. Nice scenery up here.</p>
    <p>
    Some places you where actually looking down on some mountain ridges.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-8.jpg" width="450" align="left">At 
    some parts, The Great Wall doesn't have anything to block you from falling 
    out.</p>
    <p>
    Luckily we where here when it was misty, so there was almost no wind.</p>
    <p>
    Come to think of it, I was quite warm at this point, Perhaps some wind would 
    cool me off.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-9.jpg" width="450" align="left"><br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-10.jpg" width="450" align="left">Some 
    part of the wall that you have climb to get to better parts, look like this. 
    This is all that's left of the wall right here.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall-SiMaTai-11.jpg" width="450" align="left">&quot;Dangerous 
    ahead no walking&quot;</p>
    <p>
    Sorry, I can't go any further.<br>
