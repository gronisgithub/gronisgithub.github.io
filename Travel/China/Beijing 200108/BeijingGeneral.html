    This is my second trip to Beijing. This time I was the one paying for my 
    hotels and flight. I was in Beijing on vacation, and this was the starting 
    point for me to go around in China with my 2 friends.<p>The food is nice in 
    China, as it is so different from what I'm used to. Many things are eatable, 
    and taste more or less good. As I had an Asian colleague with me last time, 
    he could guide me quite good last time. This time I had to rely on my 
    Swedish friend, to see what's good and what's not.</p>
    <p><span lang="sv">What I was supposed to pack:<br>
    5 pair of socks/underwear<br>
    5 T-shirts, preferably grey, as they will become really dirty.<br>
    1 pair of shorts<br>
    1 pair of long pants<br>
    1 shirt with long sleeves<br>
    Raingear<br>
    Cap<br>
    1 Large towell<br>
    1 Small towell<br>
    1 Quilt cover<br>
    1 Pair of boots (I took an extra pair of running shoes instead)</span></p>
    <p>Day one if this trip, I was really nervous. I had no idea of what to 
    expect of living, eating, traveling, and so on. I set the clock for 02:30, 
    as I wanted to be able to catch some sleep on the plane.<br>
    When we where on the train towards the airport, much of my butterflies in my 
    stomach went away.</p>
    <p>The flight here went really well, as we where upgraded to business class. 
    This is because we used KLM, and Nybbe (my other friend from Sweden) had a 
    silver card on KLM. Thank you KLM, and Thank you Nybbe.</p>
    <p>When we arrived in Beijing, we entered a local bus, and many people where 
    looking at us. The price was nice: 1 RMB per person for the bus. 15 times 
    cheaper than in Sweden. Later I made the discovery that it was actually more 
    expensive to walk, than to take the bus to somewhere. When walking, you need 
    more water to drink, and that cost around 2 RMB. Hence; Cheaper to take the 
    bus.</p>
    <p>The first day in Beijing, we went to the hotel, to leave our large 
    backpacks, and then we went to the Temple Of Heaven.</p>
    <p>Day 2 in Beijing, we went to Thiamin Square, and The Forbidden City.</p>
    <p>The 3rd day, we where supposed to go swimming in some lakes, but we ended 
    up going to The Great Wall, close to Si Ma Tai. By this day, I had already 
    discovered that I would not be able to join my friends, on their tour of 
    China. Major relief in telling Patrik, but also a major disappointment. I 
    just cant stay that close to people for very long. I need to be able to 
    close the door at night.</p>
    <p>The day after this, we went to World Trade Center, to get some tickets 
    for me, to fly home. The terrible showers, the mosquitoes and the not to 
    clean room became too much for me. I just had to go home. I hope I learned a 
    valuable lesson.</p>
    <p>Day 5, I went to the airport, by the bus. Once I arrived at the airport, 
    I could finally relax. I was in an environment that I feel familiar in.<br>
    I don't find any cheap hotel in Hong Kong, so I sleep in the airport, on the 
    chairs. This was more comfortable, than sleeping in the bed in the hotel. I 
    obviously didn't like the hotel in Beijing very much.</p>
    <p>The trip from Hong Kong was also nice, as I was upgraded once more. I 
    told the stewardess that my baggage was already lost, and that I would like 
    to be upgraded because of that, if they had any empty seats. It worked. 
    Thank you KLM.<br>
    The flight over China and the Gobi Desert was clear, and very nice to see 
    from the plane. Flying an airplane is really nice when it's a clear day.</p>
    <p>My baggage was 3 days late, but everything was still there.</td>
