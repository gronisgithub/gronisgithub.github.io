    USA,
    San Francisco, 1998-03<p>
    <img border="0" src="SantaClaraVeiwFromBalcony2.jpg" width="450" height="306" align="left">This 
    is the warmest place in USA I've been to. I was here during one of the 
    colder times of the year here, and it was just as warm as a Swedish spring 
    day. I had the same feeling about the weather in Sydney, Australia. Their 
    winter was quite warm for me. The difference between San Francisco and 
    Sydney is of course that one have summer when the other has winter.<br>
    When I was here, I went to the hotel pool, and just had a nice time, trying 
    to catch some rays. That week, I heard that one of the days was the official 
    day of spring. So, you can understand that people where looking strange at 
    me, using the pool in &quot;winter&quot;. I'm used to the Swedish waters, so this was 
    no problem for me.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="SantaClaraVeiwFromBalcony.jpg" width="450" height="306" align="left">View 
    from my hotel window. As this was my first trip outside Europe, I enjoyed 
    this scenery immensely. A pool that I could use any time I felt like, and it 
    was March. Nobody else wanted to use the pool, as it was too cold for them.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="GoldenGate.jpg" width="450" height="666" align="left">Just 
    as many other people, I've walked across the golden gate bridge. The picture 
    here was taken when I was standing on the bridge, looking towards the sky. 
    You feel really tiny, which unfortunately this picture does not show. All I 
    can say is that there's a 10 lane freeway between those pillars. I hope that 
    gives you an idea of how big it really is.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="HillsOfSanfrancisco.jpg" width="450" height="307" align="left">This 
    was the only picture I got that displays the hills in San Francisco.</p>
    <p>
    The traffic here is just as bad as every where else in the states. This was 
    the place where I first got in contact with fast food. It seems to me that 
    all Americans eat fast food. Probably this is just as wrong as saying that 
    all Swedes are blond and have blue eyes. But to me as tourist it appeared 
    that everyone where eating fast food; hence they all get fat.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="HardRockSanfransisco.jpg" width="450" height="578" align="left">To me they are stressing too much in the states, but a friend of mine told 
    me that this was only in the big cities. Since I have only been in the big 
    cities, I can neither confirm - nor deny this theory.<br>
    <br>
    All I can say is that from my point of view, the Scandinavian people are more relaxed than the us 
    people, and this has been confirmed to me from Israelis and Americans. It 
    could be that we don't have that big cities, and that the weather is much 
    colder. Cold weather seems to slow down time in many aspects. And when time 
    is not as much of an issue, people tend to be more relaxed.</p>

    As this was my first trip outside Europe, I had to go to Hard Rock Café.<br clear="all">
