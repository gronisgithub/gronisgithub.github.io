    USA, New York, 1999-08 <a href="ManhattanMapHuge.jpg">(See Map here)</a><p>
    The city I love in the US. All the diversity that you can find there is a 
    reason alone to visit the Manhattan Island.<br>
    All these tall buildings looks, to me, very relaxing. Since there are so 
    many people on the street all the time, it's very simple to be anonymous. 
    The people in the stores speak a lot of different language among them 
    selves, but all speak English to the customers. This makes me feel that not 
    all the citizens there are born in there. They, like me, loves Manhattan.<p>
    <img border="0" src="StatueOfLiberty.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="319">Statue 
    of Liberty. The green lady that greets you when you are approaching 
    Manhattan from the Statten Island Ferries. <br>
    <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ManhattanViewedFromStattenIslandFerry.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="298">I 
    could not find any specific food that you should try in New York, but I did 
    find a lot of Pizza-restaurants. The one I tried where a real fast food 
    place. The Pizza was almost warm there. The rats must be a problem in New 
    York. I saw a big rat in a waste basket, trying to get out. It probably just 
    had dinner. If the rats are roaming the streets, then how about under the 
    streets? Some things are better not known if you're a tourist. I can try to 
    give you a small tour of what I saw there, walking around for 9 hours (20 
    km).<br clear="all">
    <br>
    Broadway. Just follow the street and you'll cover a lot of interesting 
    areas. Their theatres are probably the most famous place on Broadway.<br>
    <br>
    World Trade Center. These buildings are huge. Very dull, but still very 
    tall. At the bottom levels you find a lot of market places. Very similar to 
    a common mall, but this is a very famous mall. Perhaps the most famous in 
    the world, what do you think?<br>
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="CityHallPark.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="297">City 
    Hall Park. The first park I encountered in Manhattan. Looking at the map, it 
    seems to be so big. Unfortunately it's very small and is not taken care of 
    very well. Still a good place to feed the birds if you fell like.<br>
    <br>
    <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="CityHall.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="302">City 
    Hall and Federal Building. At the time I was there, there was a lot of 
    commotion. A lot of people where protesting against some famous trial. I 
    expect this to be quite normal. The public always seems to think that they 
    know a lot more than the court does. Or they just want some attention. 
    Regardless, there are a lot of police officers watching the crowd, making 
    sure that there won't be a riot.<br>
    The buildings themselves are very big and tall, just like everything on 
    Manhattan. The only small buildings I saw, where the churches. This is since 
    they where built a long time ago.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="EmergencyExitstInChinaTown.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="683">Wall 
    Street and the Stock Exchange. The finance street of America. What ever goes 
    on in there will affect the rest of America, and possible the world; at 
    least in economics. There's a lot security around the Stock Exchange 
    building. Police officers around the building all the time. The building is 
    very nice, and well preserved. You won't get in, but worth a look from the 
    outside.<br>
    <br>
    Pier 17. The greatest viewpoint in Manhattan at night. Very classy, and a 
    lot of expensive and stylish stores. The place to be during night, since 
    it's so beautiful. All the restaurants are look great. Try to get some time 
    to have dinner here.<br>
    <br>
    Brooklyn Bridge. Just another bridge, but you get a very nice view over this 
    from Pier 17 at night.<br>
    <br>
    China Town. Very bad living standard here. The stores looks just like the 
    ones in China. Of course there's a lot of Asian people here. So they are 
    probably used to the bad living standard. These are almost as bad as the 
    standard that some of the &quot;black neighborhoods&quot;.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="EmpireStateBuilding.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="684">Little 
    Italy. As the name states, there's a lot of Italian people here. If you want 
    to find some odd stores, this is the place to be.<br>
    <br>
    Washington Square Park. Small park, but they have some actors performing 
    there quite often. Go there, and you'll probably find some entertainment 
    here. Bring a dollar to pay them, since they are performing for money.<br>
    <br>
    Union Square. The small marketplace in Manhattan. If you feel like going 
    shopping for some pumpkins before Halloween, then this is going to be filled 
    with people thinking like you.<br>
    <br>
    Madison Square Park. Simply a small park.<br>
    <br>
    Empire State Building. You all know it from the King Kong movie. Tall 
    building, great architecture, and very characteristic lighting during night. 
    Very simple to see this from a distance, and very majestic. Still very plain 
    compared to KLCC in Malaysia.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="LongAndStraightStreets.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="683">As 
    we all know they have a lot of very straight streets in New York. Here I am 
    at 5th Avenue and West 35th Street. San Francisco where very straight, but 
    nothing compared to this.<p>
    Chrysler Building. This building has a very famous roof. Other than that, 
    it's just tall. That's about is for Chrysler Building.<br>
    <br>
    UN Building. The least attractive place to see in Manhattan. Any Pizza place 
    is more interesting. Lots of security here; even more than the Stock 
    Exchange on Wall Street. The building it self is very plain, and tall. It's 
    located just by the water, which is the most interesting part of it.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="StPatricksCathedral.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="689">St 
    Patricks Cathedral. My guess is that every day there is a wedding, since 
    this is one of the most famous churches in the world. Just when I was 
    passing the church, this newly wedded couple came out the doors. This scene 
    where very beautiful, although all the yellow cabs and busses where hurling 
    down the street, honking their horn on anyone not moving fast enough out of 
    their way. <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="WeddingInStPatricksCathedral.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="297"><br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="CentralPark.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="300">Central 
    Park. Finally a big park in Manhattan. However, some parts of it has been 
    turned into a zoo, and you have to pay an entry fee. But it still feels nice 
    that they have preserved a park here, instead of creating all these tall 
    buildings all over the place. As you see it's a very green park, in the 
    center of New York.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TimesSquare.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="299">Times 
    Square. The place to be at new years eve. Probably a few other people will 
    be there :-). Since the place is always filled with people, I don't want to 
    imagine what it will be like on that day. If any part of Manhattan ever 
    sleeps, then this most certainly doesn't. All these neon signs, and walking 
    lights makes this place what it has been famous for.<br>
