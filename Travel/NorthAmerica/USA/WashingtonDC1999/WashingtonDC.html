    USA, Washington DC, 1999-08<p>The capital of USA. It's well worth a tour in 
    the capital.</p>
    <p>
    <img border="0" src="Arlington1.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="299">You 
    need also to see the Arlington Cemetery. The holiest place in the US 
    according to the sign. Thousands and thousands of tombstones, perfectly 
    aligned. You can walk in the Graveyard for one hour, and then turn back. 
    Quite big, isn't it? Perhaps you don't want to walk to all the places, like 
    JFK memorial, the tomb of the unknown soldier, and all the other graves. 
    Then you might want to take the bus-tour.<br clear="all">

    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Arlington3.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">Washington 
    also has it's own J. Edgar Hoover FBI building. But if you want to see just 
    any FBI Building, you should go to New York instead. The FBI in Washington 
    is smaller, but still something to see when in Washington.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Arlington4.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">When 
    you are in Washington you probably want to check out Pentagon.<br>
    It really surprised me how large that building is. Very dull looking, so you 
    could easily drive past the building, without knowing what you just went by.<br clear="all">

    <br>
    <img border="0" src="VietnamMemorial4.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="300">Make 
    sure you're not hungry when going to the city. I didn't find any place to 
    eat in the city. I might not have been looking hard enough, but I did not 
    find any place to eat for 2 hours. Not even any fast food place. Every city 
    are full of fast food places, except Washington.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="MirrorLake.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="700">Lincon 
    memorial and the reflecting lake are nice places to visit. I have no idea 
    why they built this, and why they chose a lake like this. But is sure is 
    different.<p>
    Lincon memorial and the reflecting lake are located between the White house 
    and the Vietnam Memorial. As you see, the Vietnam Memorial wall is very big. 
    So many names on the wall. This is the 2nd place you should visit in 
    Washington, next to Arlington. If you have the possibility, it's best viewed 
    after sundown. Not as crowded as during the day, and the wall looks more 
    spectacular.<p>
    The Washington monument, is lit during the night, and you can see it from 
    far away. I don't know why this is there, do you?<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="WhiteHouse.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="300">You 
    can of course see the White House. This is the only good angle for you go 
    view the White House in. Most of the other viewing angles are obstructed by 
    trees. If you want to take a tour of White House, you have to be outside 
    around 06:00 to get any tickets. I didn't feel like going there that early, 
    so I was satisfied with this view.<br clear="all">
