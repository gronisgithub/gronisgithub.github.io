    USA,
    Chicago, 1999-09<p>I can't tell you too much about this city, since I spent 
    a lot of time working.<br>
    <br>
    The pizza here really deserves it's reputation. The pizzas back home 
    basically tastes the same, no matter which toppings you have. The pizzas in 
    Chicago is a league of their own. It's hard to describe the difference, so 
    you'll just have to trust me of this. You haven't been in Chicago if you 
    haven't tried their pizzas.<br>

    We went to a great arcade-center called <a href="http://www.gameworks.com">
    Gameworks</a>.<br>
    These guys had a great system. You paid $15 for 2 hours of free games. And 
    man - did they have games.<br>
    Star wars Trilogy was a must, and they had 3 of them.<br>
    The game that caught my attention was a karate game. You have seen Virtual 
    Reality karate games, where the players seem to be just in front to you. 
    This is the opposite. You stand in a circle and kick and punch and the 
    character in the game also kicks and punches. Thankfully the 2 players never 
    came in actual physical contact with each other. You where always facing the 
    screen so you could see what your character and your opponent character 
    where doing. If you just turned your head, your friend was standing there, 
    kicking and punching at the screen, trying to knock you out.<br>
    So that was 2 hours of pure fun; a shorter version of the Macho Man weekend.<br>
    The only woman in the place was singing in a band that was playing there.</p>
