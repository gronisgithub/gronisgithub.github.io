    USA, Baltimore, 1999-08<p>
    <img border="0" src="Baltimore.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="298">Baltimore 
    seems to be just a suburb to Washington.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="BaltimoreHarbor.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="302">If 
    you feel like visiting, then you should go down to the harbor. There is 
    almost nothing else to see in Baltimore, and the harbor is very beautiful. 
    Lots of fast food places to dine. Some malls for you if you want to go 
    shopping. I spent 2 hours in the harbor, and checking out the malls. After 
    that I couldn't find any fun places to go.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="BaltimoreCity.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="297">When 
    driving out of Baltimore, I found the largest black neighborhood I've ever 
    found in the US. The living conditions where terrible there. It must be 
    difficult to go be black and pour in the US. It makes me feel fortunate that 
    I'm not one of them.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="BaltimoreMall.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="296">A 
    typical mall.<p>
    If you hear people from the US saying that you can drink the water, then you 
    should believe them. I would however not define the liquid coming out of the 
    tap as water. That liquid is better defined as chloride, fluoride and water 
    mixed, and smells/tastes terrible. So when they say that you can drink the 
    water, you know that they actually refer to bottled water. <br clear="all">
