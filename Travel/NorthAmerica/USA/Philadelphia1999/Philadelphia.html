    USA,
    Philadelphia, 1999-08<p>USA: The place to get lost at.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    <img border="0" src="CityHall1.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="297">The people living in the US are terrible at converting: Like how many feet 
    is a mile, etc... Either their system is really bad, or their education.<br>
    They always want to force people to think their way, and have trouble seeing 
    things different. I know that Sweden is not the perfect country. I mean, if 
    it where, then everybody would live there. But the Americans seem to think 
    that America is perfect.<br>
    <br>
    The driving in the US is, for me, terrible. The traffic is to stressed, and 
    their road signs seem to follow no pattern, just to confuse the driver. When 
    I was driving from the hotel to the office, I never went the same way twice 
    for the whole week. I always ended up getting lost somewhere on the way, 
    except the last day from the office to the hotel. Anyway, enough about 
    traffic.<br>
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="CityHall2.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="682">When I where there, hurricane Floyd was visiting Philly. Now that was quite 
    heavy raining. And the wind gushes where really strong. Not a very good day 
    to walk you dog. Still it was quite exciting. I had never encountered a 
    hurricane before. Only seen it on TV. To me it seems a lot worse on TV, 
    since there is always some people dying in hurricanes.<br>
    <br>
    A few days after the hurricane, I had a day off. I went to get something to 
    eat. Of course I ended up in a mall. It's amazing how big they are. You can 
    easily spend a day there, without realising that the day just passed like 
    that. I spent more than 2 hours just browsing through a record store, and I 
    did not buy anything in the mall. If you haven't tried to visit a big mall, 
    I would clearly recommend it. Just for you to see how Americans can spend so 
    long time shopping.</p>
    <p>
    I found a fun thing at the Coca Cola cans. It had printed on it: nutrition 
    facts. Nutrition in a Coke? You're kidding. Where can you find any trace of 
    nutrition in a Coke?<br>
    <br>
    One thing that I found in Philly, that I did not find in Asia food wise, is 
    fried union rings. I was tired of the French fries in Burger King, so I tied 
    their fried union rings, and to my surprise they where very good. So good 
    that I asked around where I could get fried union rings, except for Burger 
    King.</p>
    <p>
    Another tasty experience are Philly's cheese steaks. Try them, and you'll 
    see. So my favorite would be a cheese steak with fried union rings. Very 
    healthy :-)))</p>

    <br>
    When I was driving in Philly, I found something I didn't expect to find. The 
    clear segregation of black and white people. One minute there where only 
    white folks on the street, and the next it was all black people there. I've 
    heard so much good things about the US, that segregation doesn't exist any 
    more. That's a complete lie.<br>
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="RockyStaircase.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="287">When you are in Philadelphia 
    there are things that you just have to see, and 
    places to visit.<br>
    <br>
    The steps to the Museum of Art have become quite famous from a motion 
    picture, starring Sylvester Stallone.<br>
    Just next to this museum, you can find the boat house row. You get a really 
    nice view from the museum.<br>
    <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="LibertyBell.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="300">Liberty bell is the most famous one right now. Take a wild guess if this 
    hung in Liberty hall and where an essential part of the declaration of 
    independence (at least according to the guide). Liberty hall is seen in the 
    background.<br>
    <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="WhereLibertyBellUsedToBe.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="300"><br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ModernArt.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="298">Downtown Philly, is South Street. The tourist Trap. Lots of commotion, and 
    very nice atmosphere at the restaurants. If you're there, this is the place 
    to get a Philly Cheese Steak.<br>
    <br>
    Society hill is quite close. Lots of old English-style houses. Very nice, 
    and a quiet part of Philly. You cant believe that only a few streets away, 
    the traffic is constant chaos.<br>
    <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="PhillyByNight.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="298">I was fortunate enough to watch a hockey game in Philly. It was a blast. 
    Thanks to my colleague, we go the best seats in the house; Dead center, and 
    5th row. It gave you the distance from the rink to be able to see all of it, 
    and the closeness to talk to the players (that where fortunate enough to end 
    up in the penalty box).<br>
    As in all American hockey games, there was a lot of fighting, and a few 
    goals. From what I heard, there where over 300 penalty-minutes given to the 
    players during this game. Fortunately Philadelphia won, against the odds. So 
    if you have the opportunity, and are interested in hockey, then I'd tell you 
    to go see one. It's the differences between the &quot;normal&quot; hockey you, and the 
    American hockey that fascinates me.<br>
    <br>
    Close to Philadelphia, you have some Amish people. Their belief is to use 
    the old fashion tools, like horse and carriage. Also their style of clothes 
    are old fashioned. They all have the same haircuts, and very out of style. 
    To me it seems that they want to live the way that people have done for 
    three hundred years. Kind of like the old fashioned way you see in the old 
    western movies. I wouldn't be too surprised if some of the movie people have 
    used the Amish people as research for how things used to be. These are the 
    last people that I would ever expect ever go get a homepage.<br>
    <br>
    US is the land of freedom. At least that's what every American keeps telling 
    us. To me, their perception of freedom is strange. Police officers are not 
    allowed to test the level of alcohol in your blood. All they can do is ask 
    you if you have been drinking. Is there anyone that answers yes on that 
    question??<br>
    Anyway, I would agree that they have the freedom, and the police does not 
    invade your life then. But then the citizens can't cross the street on a red 
    light, without risking a fine. Where did the freedom go?<br>
    <br>
    When we where driving, we normally listen to the radio. After a while we 
    tuned to a rap station. Every few words where missing due to censuring. Is 
    that freedom?<br>
    <br>
    They do have some real freedom, though. If you see a stop sign, that doesn't 
    mean to stop fully, only slow down. And if you want to turn right, when 
    there is a red light - go ahead. It's most often perfectly legal.<br>
    <br>
    In the US there's a thing called Obsessive Behavior. And you can get a 
    fine, or worse, for that. Now, this seems to me that the police wants to 
    make everyone fit in to a box, and nobody is allowed to be outside those 
    bounds. So who decides what's out of the ordinary? Women are not allowed to 
    be topless at the beach. I always thought that you where born naked, and we 
    all look basically the same underneath our clothes. But in the US you can be 
    slapped with a fine for doing that. <br clear="all">
