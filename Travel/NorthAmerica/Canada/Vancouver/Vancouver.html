    Canada,
    Vancouver, 1999-09<p>The only real memory I have here, was that I tried 
    French toast with maple syrup. It gave me a new taste for breakfast, and 
    actually quite OK. I normally get normal bread and honey, so the difference 
    was not that big. But small changes are also welcome.<br>
    <br>
    My colleagues called Vancouver, Canada: &quot;Hongcouver, Japanada.&quot; This is 
    because there are so many Asian people having lots of businesses in 
    Vancouver. The computer/electronic shops where almost only operated by Asian 
    people.<br>
    <br>
    Nature in Vancouver seems to very familiar to me. The trees, birds, weather 
    resembles very much to southern Sweden. Cold, windy, and the birds are 
    usually quite small. </p>
