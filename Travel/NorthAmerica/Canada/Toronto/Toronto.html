    Canada, Toronto, 2003-09<p>
    <img border="0" src="TorontoFromCNTowerNight.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="673">Toronto 
    is famous for the tallest building in the world, the CN Tower. Here I'm 
    looking down on the skyscrapers far below.<p>
    The fare is around 25 Canadian Dollars, and It's well worth going up just 
    before sundown, to see it both in daylight, and at night.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TorontoFromCNTowerDay.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="673">The 
    tall buildings seem really tiny. Even the giant red crane on top of the 
    building, in the lower right corner, seems small.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="FamousBuildingShape.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="709">Here's 
    a familiar building shape. I guess I have seen a very similar in NewYork,<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TorontoByNight.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">When 
    looking at the giant buildings from the ground, they have trouble fitting in 
    the picture. Quite different from looking at them from the tower.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="CNTowerByNight.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="673">Here's 
    the giant tower. And look: There's a UFO on the upper left hand corner of 
    the image ;-).<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TorontoLandscape.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">The 
    landscape of Toronto is quite impressive. Toronto is one of the nicest 
    cities that I have visited. Many friendly people, average prices, good road 
    signs.<p>
    I also discovered that the cars in Toronto (and Canada?) only use 87-91 
    octane fuel, compared to out 95-98. To label the 91 &quot;super clean&quot; is not 
    quite fair in my oppinion. <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TorontoStockExchange.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="673">The 
    Toronto Stock Exchange. Like many buildings in the center, it's just huge.<p>
    The Chinatown was really good, and quite like the real thing.<p>
    Traffic, and traffic queues, where quite heavy, going in and out of the 
    center.<p>
    To summarize: Very large nice city, with many friendly people. Not too many 
    extremely fat people, as in the US.<br clear="all">
