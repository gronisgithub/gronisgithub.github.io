    2001-11-14<p>Uschi gave me a lift to the ferries in Helsingborg around 2-3 
    pm. On the train in Denmark, the speaker system announced something about 
    the train not being able to go any further after a few stops. So I left the 
    train, not knowing what to do. Just after I left, the train took off, and 
    left me on the platform. So I had to wait for the next train that arrives 20 
    minutes later. Luckily I was well ahead of the schedule, so I didn't have to 
    worry about missing the flight to Paris. And as I was wearing the most 
    important clothes for Antarctica, I didn't have to be cold (-3 degrees 
    Celsius on the platform in Denmark).</p>
    <p>And then on Kastrup Airport, I managed to loose my boarding card. Really 
    loose it. And I lost it while walking to the gate. I put the boarding card 
    into my pocket when I started to walk to the gate. And at the gate, I could 
    not find it. But I thought: 'Well, this is a big airport. I can't be the 
    first person to loose their boarding card. I'm sure they will solve it. I 
    still have my passport to prove who I am'.<br>
    They solved it of course. I just had to show them my complete ticket where 
    it said that I would go on this trip.</p>
    <p>&quot;If this will be the worst thing that will happen this trip, then I'll be fine.&quot; 
    (Later on it turned out that this was the worst thing that would happen to 
    me as an individual. It was a very smooth vacation.)</p>
    <p>2001-11-15</p>
    <p>For some reason, I slept well between Paris and Buenos Aires. I guess it 
    was because I had 1 slim woman on either side of me, and they did not 
    disturb me at all. They made me feel so safe, that I slept for approx 9 
    hours.</p>
    <p>When we arrived to the hotel, it turns out that I would share room with 
    Stefan Karlsson (just as I thought when I got the papers back home). I was 
    prepared with earplugs if this person would start to snore in the night. But 
    I didn't have to use them outside the plane even once. Stefan is also a 
    person that I felt very safe with, and I slept very well, sharing my room 
    (and cabin on the boat) with him.</p>
    <p>Later that day, we went to a small national park in Buenos Aires where we 
    got to see some exotic animals, like hummingbird.</p>
    <p>During the afternoon, we went to see the &quot;sites&quot; to visit in Buenos 
    Aires. Amazing that a city of that magnitude has so little to offer. Perhaps 
    I'm interested in the wrong things.<br>
    We got to see the Soccer team that Diego Maradona first started in. And I 
    got to know that the colors of the team originates from the Swedish Flag.<br>
    The tour also showed us a small neighborhood with many colorful houses where 
    the Tango originated.<br>
    A Steamship that rescued Dr. Otto Nordenskjöld.<br>
    The pink &quot;government building&quot; that lies just by the central square. This is 
    the 'equality' of the White house, but this is pink instead.</p>
    <p>For dinner, I had beef, prepared in the Argentine way. This is very 
    bloody. After I tried the salad, the other Swedish people told me that I 
    should not eat the salad here. It may upset my stomach very much.<br>
    After the very rare beef, and a bite of the salad, I didn't feel very 
    secure. But fortunately I didn't get sick at all.</p>
    <p>I really like the look of the South American women. Most of them have 
    very long black hair.</p>
    <p>2001-11-16</p>
    <p>I was freezing at the hotel this night, but other than that I was 
    sleeping very well.<br>
    The breakfast was very nice, with lots of fruit.</p>
    <p>The flight from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia was easy. Before we left Buenos 
    Aires, I had a look at the Tax Free, but I found nothing that I wanted to 
    get.</p>
    <p>The hotel in Ushuaia was very nice. Situated high above the city. The 
    birdlife around the hotel was the best I have ever seen. This trip was really 
    starting nicely, nature wise.</p>
    <p>In the afternoon we used the aerial cableway to get a bit higher up, and 
    closer to the glacier. Nice landscape, but not a very exciting hike. The 
    guide proved himself a 2nd time (after the national park in Buenos 
    Aires). He really knows a lot. Plants and animals. He knows them all (if you 
    ask me, and you are on my homepage, so you are asking me :-) ).</p>
    <p>In the afternoon, me, a friend, and other folks in our group went down to 
    the city. Me and my fried went out to buy some souvenirs. We had pizza 
    (which was somewhat a specialty here it seems), and then we went to an 
    Internet Café. Unfortunately my friend forgot his bag with souvenirs in the 
    restaurant (called &quot;Ideal Bar&quot;), and the place was closed the day after.<p>
    2001-11-17<p>This night in the hotel in Ushuaia I didn't freeze, and that 
    felt really good. I had a good night sleep.<p>We went to the national park 
    in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tierradelfuego.org.ar/">Tierra del 
    fuego</a>. In the national park I could see some mountains in Chile, very 
    clearly.<p>After the nice tour in the national park, we had some time to 
    spend in the city. The weather was very nice, and I didn't need a jacket.<p>
    We boarded the ship, threw the lines at 18:30, and entered the Beagle channel. 
    This day, I saw my first 
    Albatross, and my first penguins. This beginning was very promising.
    After a while, we passed Puerto Williams, Chile (most southerly “town” in the 
    world). It really feels like the local's think that this is the end of the 
    world, and here we are going &quot;to the end and 
    beyond&quot;. This phrase looks better in writing, than in reality. 
    We're still on mother earth.<p>
    2001-11-18<p>
    This night, I woke up to the sound of my falling tripod in my 
    cabin. The ship is rocking a bit, to say the least.<p>
    The breakfast was nice, but not so many people attended the breakfast 
    (probably due to the waves). After breakfast, I went up to the bridge 
    (actually just outside the bridge), to scout for animals. I got to se a few 
    albatrosses (black-browed-, and wandering-). I also saw 2 small Magellan 
    penguins.<p>
    During the day we had a few interesting lectures. I attended 
    them, and enjoyed them.<p>
    I wrote in my 'diary': I hope I got some good photos of 
    birds today. It turns out that most of them where not so good.<p>
    Today, I must have been somewhat seasick, as I got quite 
    tired. I didn't feel bad at all, as I had my anti sea sickness patch behind 
    my ear. And the headache (and the tiredness) went away after a headache 
    pill.<p>
    At 19:30, we where at Lat/long: 52°27’S / 62°13’W. 7 
    degrees in the water and in the air. Wind speed was 10 m/s.<p>
    2001-11-19<p>
    Land! Landings on the Falkland Islands. I got to see many 
    Penguins and Albatrosses.<p>
    On the first landing, we had some walking to do, to get to 
    see the Penguins and Black-browed Albatrosses. It was really windy. Just 
    like the Albatrosses like it. And it was very rewarding after the walk. Very 
    rewarding. The animals are quite noisy, and the cacophony was like music to 
    my ears.<p>
    There's a saying on the Falkland Islands: If you don't like the weather on 
    the Falkland Islands, just wait 15 minutes. This was certainly true for the 
    first landing on WestPoint Island.<p>
    The second landing was on Saunders Island. Clear skies. Just 
    pure sunshine. Paradise on earth, but a little bit cold for paradise. And on 
    the sand beach, we saw penguins everywhere. Even more beautiful than any 
    brochure could ever look like. This is the most beautiful place I have ever 
    seen in the world.<p>
    We had the option to stay on the beach, or to go with one of 
    the guides to the top of a mountain (400 meter high). I chose to go to the 
    top, as there was supposed to be a great view according to the guide that 
    would lead the walk. We first went up to an Albatross colony. We rested 
    there in the sun for a while. It was great lying resting there in the sun.<br>
    We continued to the top, and the climb was quite tough for me, and took over 
    one hour to complete. It was much more difficult to walk here, than on The 
    Great Wall. When I finally reached the top, to have a view of the landscape, 
    I was really disappointed. That's when I decided: No more walks for me. I 
    could have been at the beach, taking photos of these lovely penguins in this 
    excellent weather.<p>
    I got headache  from the bright sunshine before lunch. 
    A pill solved the headache, and Sunglasses where added to my daily outfit.<br>
    My clothes got quite wet from sweat and water. Sunscreen is a must here. I 
    was using factor 25.<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 51°21'S / 60°40’W. 12 degrees in the water 
    and 7 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 12 m/s. Barometric pressure: 998 mb.<p>
    2001-11-20<p>
    We arrived to Stanley (Capital of the Falkland Islands) with a bang. Wind 
    speed of 20 m/s made it difficult to approach the pier, so we had a bit of a 
    bumpy encounter. Nothing to worry about though. I 
    didn't find anything interesting in the village. Probably because I want to 
    see some more Penguins, and not Houses. Stanley has a population of less 
    than 2000.<p>
    And as Stanley is on the Falkland Islands, and the Falkland 
    Islands are very windy, Stanley is a really windy city. So windy that they 
    can't have any gravel on the playgrounds, as the gravel would blow away. 
    Only grass and rubber carpets.<p>
    Horses are grazing on lawns in the village. Very exotic for 
    me. Never seen that in any other village. Not in the center of the village.<p>
    When I was walking in Stanley, it felt like the city was 
    rocking a little bit like the rocking of the ocean. Of course, the land was 
    not rocking. Land is land. It was me that was &quot;land sick&quot;. Luckily I was 
    still wearing my anti seasickness patch, so I did not feel ill. I know that 
    I would feel ill, as this was the same sensation as I last had in Cairns, 
    Australia.<p>
    The wind was not blowing in a friendly direction so we could not leave the 
    harbor for 3 hours. Finally at 19:00, it was off for South Georgia.<p>
    At 20:00, we where at Lat/long: 51°41’ S 57°30’W. 13 degrees in the water 
    and 8 degrees in the air. Wind speed was as low as 2 m/s. Barometric 
    pressure: 1002 mb.<p>
    2001-11-21<p>
    Just after I woke up, I went up on deck to scout for Whale. I really like to 
    be on deck, looking for animals. Smelling the fresh air, and feeling the 
    Antarctic region as much as possible.<p>
    After a while I went down to have breakfast, and went right back up on deck 
    to continue watching for wildlife. The walk to the top of the mountain, and 
    visiting Stanley showed me what I wanted to do. I wanted to see as much 
    wildlife as I possible could. Landscape, animals, and experience Antarctica 
    first hand, as close as possible. That's what I want to do this trip. 
    Lectures is something I can do when the fog is too thick, and when Anders is 
    having some Lectures about animals. The rest of the time, I'll be on deck, 
    or on the bridge.<p>
    Once we saw 5 albatrosses circling around the ship at once. This was really 
    much at the time.<p>
    Anders saw a whale, and he could determine which specie it was. None of the 
    rest of us ever saw the whale for 2 reasons. We had no idea of how whale 
    spray looks like. And the second reason, is that Anders is just incredible 
    when it comes to searching for animals.<p>
    The sea was calm today again.<p>
    I really long to see some more King Penguin(s). I really long for them!<p>
    At 09:00, we where at Lat/long: 52°15’ S / 52°17’W. 8 degrees in the water 
    and 8 degrees in the air. Wind speed was&nbsp; 13 m/s. Barometric pressure: 
    1004 mb.<p>
    2001-11-22<p>
    A long day. Just waiting to get to South Georgia. A lot of fog, but on some 
    places it was clear.<p>
    Spent most of the day, looking for Whale and other wildlife. I finally know 
    how Whale spray looks like! I've seen a few whales, or actually I've seen 
    Whale spray. The whales where very far away.<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 53°02'S / 45°34’W. 3 degrees in the water 
    and 3 degrees in the air, which means that we passed the convergence today. 
    So now we are in the Antarctic eco system. Wind speed was 13 m/s. Barometric 
    pressure: 1008 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 03:43/19:57<p>
    2001-11-23<p>
    My eyes where strange today again. I have trouble reading a few hours after 
    I switch to a new anti seasickness patch. And my mouth gets even more dry 
    now. This is because I had to change patches yesterday night.<p>
    We finally arrived to South Georgia.<p>
    We entered the zodiacs (rubber boat for 12 people), and where cruising 
    around among Sea lions, Fur seals, and Elephant Seal. We didn't go ashore in 
    Elsehul Bay.<p>
    During the cruise, I saw the most adoring penguin walking on the shore. As 
    many Elephant Seals where lying there, the seals where fighting from time to 
    time. And when they did, the penguin just stopped to wait them out. And then 
    my penguin continued on his walk, very cautiously and on guard. But on the 
    other hand, he had the attitude 'Don't try this at home folks, I'm a skilled 
    professional.&quot; A Totally adorable Gentoo Penguin.<p>
    The second time we entered the zodiacs, we went to Albatross Island. We went 
    ashore through the kelp, and watched nesting Albatrosses and Giant Petrels. 
    These birds are enormous. The wings alone are a delight to watch.<br>
    A few of us ended up with feet stuck in the mud and requiring assistance to 
    be extricated.<p>
    The third excursion was to Salisbury Plains. Over 100.000 King Penguin 
    couples nest here. Too bad the fog was not as thin as I would want it to be.<p>
    But I finally got to experience these charming penguins up close. If you 
    approach them, they avoid you. They don't want to get stomped, or attacked. 
    But if you stop, they will very slowly try to figure out what you are. They 
    are very curious. And this makes them even more charming.<p>
    The chicks where quite large when I paid my visit. And the chicks are even 
    more curious than the adults. The chicks have never seen anything else than 
    the land on which they where born. We where just as fascinating to them, as 
    they where to us.<p>
    Too bad we could not stay here for some more time. On a better day, this 
    would have been even better to visit. I just can't get enough of these 
    Penguins (I like the King Penguins the most).<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 53°55’S / 38°09’W (approaching Elsehul). 3 
    degrees in the water and 1 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 9 m/s. 
    Barometric pressure: 1006 mb. First iceberg seen at 53°27’S / 41°54’W. 
    Sunrise/sunset: 03:14/19:30<p>
    2001-11-24<p>
    Today we visited another giant King Penguin colony at
    Fortuna Bay, before 
    breakfast. These penguins where even more curious. 2 
    of them wanted to taste a piece of my tripod.<p>
    I was really busy taking pictures, so I did not see the penguin standing one 
    meter behind me. When I turned around, I got a bit scared, as I didn't 
    expect anyone standing there. The penguin also got scared because I turned 
    around so quickly. Mr. Penguin was looking scared at me, and decided to turn 
    around and walk away fairly quickly. It is very difficult to study 'objects' 
    if the 'object' is studying you and your behavior at the same time. Most 
    disturbing :-)<p>
    The penguin sound, sounds just like trumpets. Actually, one sex of the King 
    Penguin sound like several different trumpets are in ALMOST perfect 
    synchronization. Very very beautiful. The other sex sound like only a single 
    trumpet. Still nice, but the multi trumpet sound is nicer.<p>
    And the Gentoo Penguins look so funny when they are walking. Stretching 
    their wings as far back as they possible are able to, and then they start to 
    think of where they should walk. A very funny walk.<p>
    We also went to Strömnäs, and to the ghost town Grytviken (with only 4 
    residents). Not too interesting. No penguins or Albatrosses. Only the 
    remains of the glory of Whaling. Doesn't make me feel very good. I want to 
    leave this place as soon as possible.<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 54°08’S / 36°49’W (approaching Strömnäs to 
    arrive 10am). 2 degrees in the water and 1 degrees in the air. Wind speed 
    was 2 m/s. Barometric pressure: 1005 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 03:40/19:55<p>
    2001-11-25<p>
    Fog during morning. Very dense fog. Quite bad, and boring. After a while, 
    the fog got so dense. And then it was raining and snowing instead. <p>
    When we entered Royal Bay (Moltke 
    Harbor to be more precise), we felt the strong Glacier winds hurling down 
    towards us. But we where going to try to go ashore. And when we where on our 
    way in the zodiacs, the weather started to clear close to land. The fog 
    disappeared completely close to land.<p>
    We saw some deer here. Also a small group of King Penguins, and 2 mating 
    elephant seals. A quite nice place to visit. While watching the king 
    penguins, one member of my group threw a stone close to the penguins (I 
    guess to see how they would react or so). I was not impressed.<p>
    On our way back, our zodiac want close to the glacier. We picked up some 
    glacier ice to have in the bar.<p>
    The second landing (Cooper 
    Bay) was in the middle of very very many sea lions. And to 
    walk up to the Macaroni Penguin colony, we had to walk among the seals. We 
    where scared of them, and they where scared of us. The guide leading the 
    walk to the colony, got really close to the seals. He had to move some seals 
    from the path, just by approaching them so the seals would not feel 
    comfortable. This worked, but was not a good approach according to me. After 
    a while, the guide almost stumbled on a seal, and got very close to the 
    seal. The seal got terribly scared, and so did the guide. They guide jumped 
    away from the seal. So as you can see, the walk was not without danger. I 
    did not feel very comfortable with the walk. Is this really the way that 
    experts lead the tourists?<p>
    The sound of Macaroni Penguins is not at all as enjoyable as that of a King 
    Penguin. And they don't have the looks either, but they are cute in their 
    own way.<p>
    The smell of the many Sea lion, the many Penguins, and the mud didn't smell 
    very well. It was really intense. But still, I like this smell a lot more 
    than the smell of a burning cigarette, or an used cigarette. And it's Great 
    to be here in South Georgia, even if the guides have sometimes strange 
    ideas. It was the same guide leading this walk, as was leading the walk to 
    the top of the mountain in the Falklands Islands in the perfect weather.<p>
    When we where going back with the zodiac from the sea lion and penguin 
    colony, we where cruising around among the ice and the icebergs. I always 
    thought that Icebergs and ice in water is generally quiet, that the only 
    thing that I would hear would be the wind and the waves splashing against 
    the ice. But it turns out that the ice is &quot;clicking&quot; or &quot;Snapping&quot; or so. 
    Like constant cracking of nuts, or tiny firecrackers.. You learn something 
    new down here every day.<p>
    At 20:00, we where at Lat/long: 54°50’S / 35°47’W (Cooper Bay). 1.7 degrees 
    in the water and 1.5 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 20+ m/s. Barometric 
    pressure: 973 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 03:44/20:05<p>
    2001-11-26<p>
    Storm. Strong headwind. The entire day.<p>
    The wind was blowing at 32 m/s, so we had a hurricane in the morning. But 
    after a while it calmed down to a full blown storm. During the day we had 
    waves as high as 18 meter. During the evening, the storm calmed down some 
    more, but it was still very very windy (20 m/s). During most of the storm, 
    we had a real speed of 3 knots, which is about 6 km/h.<p>
    I got seasick, and I think that it was because I was only wearing half a 
    patch. I now know that this was not a good decision to make last night. So I 
    switched to a full patch, and went to sleep for 2 hours. After this, I felt 
    fine again. The bad thing about adding the full patch today, was that I was 
    not able to read during the day. But I would rather have the reading problem 
    than the seasickness. 10-15 other passengers where seasick.<p>
    Standing on the bridge, and becoming close to weightless for a second, as 
    the boat was going up and down on the high waves from the storm was a very 
    delightful feeling. And as the bow was heading down towards the water in a 
    breathtaking speed, the few of us that where standing on the bridge where 
    all hoping that the bow would smash into the next wave in perfect timing, 
    creating a tremendous splash. This was quite often the case. And thrilling 
    to watch.<p>
    The Albatross where airborne during the storm. I watched with amazement as 
    the albatross flew by us. It was not flapping it's wings. And still it 
    managed to easily outrun us, heading straight into the 28 m/s headwind of 
    the storm. Headwind! Our engines where at full power, and still this 
    magnificent bird didn't seem to bother about the rough weather. It was 
    cruising around, in between the waves, catching the wind perfectly every 
    time. Never once I saw an Albatross do any mistake when flying a few 
    centimeters above the surface of the water.<p>
    To me, the albatrosses has earned their right to 'say': &quot;Flapping with your 
    wings are for beginner birds. I have taken the next step in evolution, and 
    now I'm passed this petty flapping. All you have to do to fly, is just to 
    stretch out your wings, unless the wind is net strong enough.&quot; The albatross 
    is a truly magnificent bird. One worth to admire. But the sailors knew that 
    centuries ago.<p>
    The icebergs we saw where very large, I thought. They seemed completely 
    unaffected by the high waves we had today. I mean unaffected as to go up and 
    down, like the ship is doing. They where not unaffected by the waves 
    splashing.<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 55°06’S / 37°33’W (south of South Georgia, 
    and not very far from where we where 11 hours ago). 1 degree in the water 
    and 1 degree in the air. Wind speed was finally down to 25 m/s (we passed 
    through a Force 12 gale). Barometric pressure: 975 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 
    02:28/20:17<p>
    2001-11-27<p>
    Almost no wind at all. The wind is around 10 m/s, and it feels like dead 
    calm wind.<p>
    We saw a few spray this morning.<p>
    To compare this with my trip to Svalbard. Every landing we have done here, 
    has been a lot better than the best landing on Svalbard.<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 57°36’S / 40°53’W (South Georgia &amp; South 
    Orkneys). 1 degree in the water and 0 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 11 
    m/s. Sunrise/sunset: 03:01/20:36<p>
    2001-11-28<p>
    At 03:15 we where passing the South Orkney Islands (20 minutes after the sun 
    went up).<p>
    Spectacular Icebergs there. Great weather (compared to most of the weather 
    we had the last 6 days). I took many photos of these nice icebergs. At 03:30 
    we where passing Laurie Island.<p>
    At 08:30 we saw a giant iceberg. It was 700 meters long. This was a giant 
    tabular iceberg. I.e. It is very flat, and is just a piece of ice that has 
    broken loose from an ice shelf. It was in the vicinity of 50 meters high 
    above water.<p>
    Later during the day, we got to see an even larger iceberg. 9 kilometers 
    long, and 4 kilometers wide, and over 30 meter high. Impressive. This iceberg looked just as stable 
    as land, viewing it from our ship that was rocking back and forth.<p>
    And it was quite rocky at sea today. The wind was most of the time around 20 
    m/s. So it's close to storm.<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 61°04’S / 45°19’W (near South Orkney Islands). 
    Check the distance we covered the last 24 hours, and compare it to the days 
    before. 0 degrees 
    in the water and 0 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 18 m/s. Barometric 
    pressure: 989 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 02:56/19:58<p>
    2001-11-29<p>
    The largest iceberg we would see for the entire trip. It showed up at 05:00. 
    It was 42 km long, and 16 km wide. And I remember how fascinated I was when 
    I saw the 700 meter iceberg. It was impressive. This is just ridiculously 
    big.<p>
    The wind speed was at a constant rate of around 20 m/s. It was snowing most 
    of the time. And as some blue ice passed the ship, I went out from the 
    warmth of the bridge wearing my t-shirt, to take photos of the blue ice.<p>
    The waves does not feel so large today, and I don't think that it is rocking 
    so much back and forth. Probably because we are much closer to Antarctica, 
    and there's not so much wind.<p>
    We had no way to go ashore on Antarctica, as it was too windy, and the 
    zodiacs will not be used if the wind is more than 14 m/s. I guess that it 
    would not be very comfortable (or safe) to have a seat in the zodiacs when 
    the wind is 20 m/s.<p>
    We really want to go ashore, as this is the forth day we have not been off 
    the ship. We tried to go ashore on Danger Islands, and on Paulet Island, and 
    in Hope Bay (where the Argentinean research station Esperanza is) but it was 
    too windy (20-25 m/s). Anders dealt with this in the best possible way. Schnapps for all 
    of us. And as us Swedes like to sing schnapps songs, we soon got the 
    approval of the rest of 
    the passengers, of our singing. (Especially the Swedish version of 
    'Happy Birthday', but that's a whole other story all by itself.)<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 63°00’S / 53°10’W (approaching Danger 
    Islands). -1 degree 
    in the water and -3 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 18 m/s. Barometric 
    pressure: 990 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 03:03/20:31<p>
    2001-11-30<p>
    During the morning, we approached Astrolabe Island. This time we really 
    tried to get ashore, but mother nature said no once again. The waves at the 
    beach &quot;were better suited for adventure surfing than a zodiac landing&quot;. <p>
    We head north to the South Shetland Island, and we are able to land there at 
    17:30 (Half Moon Island). On land it was quite windy, and it was snowing. We where walking on 
    the snow, and I fell easily thru the first 'layer', ending up with my knee 
    buried under the snow. This made it difficult to walk, but I soon realized 
    that I should walk closer to the stones if I was not too close to Penguins. 
    Then it was so much easier to walk, but if I fell, I would hurt myself and 
    my camera much more.<br>
    We really needed to set foot on land, and the crew had 
    noticed this.<p>
    I was a little bit cold when we got back, but it was nice to walk on land. 
    And land is not rocking, as I thought it would. Even the penguin dropping 
    was nice to smell, just because I know I will see penguins then. (Have you 
    noticed how much I like penguins yet?)<p>
    Around midnight we sailed into the caldera of Deception Island. Astounding 
    landscape. Some one called it a &quot;moonscape&quot;, and I concur. Too dark for my 
    camera, but not for my eyes and memory.<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 63°17’S / 59°16’W (approaching Astrolabe 
    Island). 0 degrees 
    in the water and -2 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 18 m/s. Barometric 
    pressure: 973 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 03:10/22:48<p>
    2001-12-01<p>
    Sunny weather. Nice weather. Not so much wind when we where on our zodiac 
    cruise. Beautiful Landscape, Penguins on small icebergs (ice sheets and ice 
    hills?), calm water, blue ice. Just wonderful. It was a long time ago that 
    we had nice weather, and for a few hour we had some.<p>
    The crew worked hard to get us to set foot on the Antarctic continent. So in 
    the afternoon we made a desperate attempt to do so. And we made it. We where 
    standing on continent granite. However, if we where standing on the actual 
    continent where disputed, as we saw some water surrounding the place we 
    where standing on. The spot of land we could stand on did not fit everyone, 
    so we had to go ashore in turns. Most amusing. We named the spot &quot;Cape Ninet&quot;, 
    as she was the first passenger to set foot on the spot. And we where quite 
    sure that nobody had ever landed there before, as it was a very 
    insignificant piece of land.<p>
    To me it was more important to dip my fingers in the waters of Antarctica. 
    Not as cold as I expected, but I have been in cold temperature for quite 
    some time now, and that might have affected my judgment of what's cold and 
    what's not.<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 63°57’S / 60°50’W (Curtiss Bay). 0 degrees 
    in the water and -2 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 15 m/s. Barometric 
    pressure: 990 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 02:40/23:40<p>
    2001-12-02<p>
    Penguins on the first landing (Andvord Bay/Neko Harbour), and very nice landscape. The weather was OK 
    today. I really like being in Antarctica.<br>
    From high above the water, I saw a Minke whale swimming in the ocean.<p>
    During lunch today, it was Barbeque, and we where supposed to dress 
    appropriately. So I wore T-shirt and Shorts.<p>
    After Lunch we saw a 2 Gentoo Penguins Playing. They where jumping up on an 
    Ice floe, and then juming into the water again. They had fun several times, 
    just by jumping up and down on the Ice floe.<p>
    The second landing (Cuverville Island) was just perfect. Lots of penguins, and a stony beach. 
    The tide was low, and the sun was shining so the stones on the beach where 
    dry and fairly clean. I sat down on the beach, and after a while penguins 
    started to cross the beach, just a meter or two away. Most of them stopped 
    for a while when they got close to me, but decided that I was not dangerous, 
    after a few seconds, and continued on their way. They where going in front 
    of me, close to the water, or behind me, close to the wall of snow. And the 
    penguins where most adorable.<br>
    One penguin found a nice stone (I thought it looked like any stone), that it 
    wanted to give to it's partner. But decided that the stone was to heavy to 
    carry, and put the stone back on the ground.<br>
    The sound of their small 'feet' against the rocks where also nice to listen 
    to. That was all the noise they made when walking.<br>
    Even when 2 partners met each other, they where nodding at the same time for 
    a while, and then both continued to the nest. No sound, only visual signals 
    of 'we belong together'.<p>
    I was wearing sunscreen factor 25, that I had applied in the morning. I was 
    still burned by the sun when sitting on the beach at the second landing. I 
    write this as a reminder to myself If I ever will visit here again. Apply 
    sunscreen atleast twice a day, even on not so sunny days.<p>
    This was our last stay at Antarctica. From now on it's just heading home. 
    :-(((((<p>
    While heading home, we saw 10 Orcas, and the ship followed them for 15 
    minutes. I was out photographing them wearing a t-shirt, but that got too 
    cold after a while (10 minutes).<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 64°50’S / 62°33’W (approaching Neko Harbor). 
    0 degrees 
    in the water and 0 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 6 m/s. Barometric 
    pressure: 985 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 02:28/23:15<p>
    2001-12-03<p>
    Drakes passage. Quite calm. Only 10 m/s wind before lunch, and a little bit 
    increasing during evening.<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 62°24’S / 64°10’W (Drakes passage). 0 degrees 
    in the water and 0 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 15 m/s. Barometric 
    pressure: 975 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 03:57/22:21<p>
    2001-12-04<p>
    Storm on Drakes passage (a Force 10 gale), during night and early morning. Calming down a bit 
    before lunch, and even more during afternoon. The wind was between 10-20 m/s 
    all afternoon, continuously changing from minute to minute.<p>
    The challenge was to take a shower, when the ship was rocking back and 
    forth. But staying on the bridge was just as fun as always. Perhaps even 
    more fun than expected, because the sun was shining. During the whole windy (and stormy) day, the sun was shining with 
    perfect clarity. Clear skies. Not your average storm: Storm and beautiful 
    weather at the same time.<p>
    At 20:30 we rounded Cape Horn. I had heard quite many stories about it, and 
    there it was. Just a big cliff it seemed. I was already longing back to 
    Antarctica, so I didn't pay that much attention to it.<p>
    At 07:00, we where at Lat/long: 58°32’S / 66°10’W (approaching Cape Horn). 4 degrees 
    in the water and 4 degrees in the air. Wind speed was 25 m/s, and clear 
    skies. Barometric pressure: 976 mb. Sunrise/sunset: 04:15/22:08<p>
    2001-12-05<p>
    The day it all went wrong.<p>
    I had to leave the ship. This was not a pleasant thing to do. I would rather 
    stay a few months more. Much more than going ashore. I did not want to leave 
    my home. My home was my cabin, and the bridge, and the deck on this boat.<p>
    At the end of the gangway, there was supposed to be Penguins, seals, etc. 
    Not civilization. Not civilization.<p>
    We went around a bit in Ushuaia, and the weather was great. Like I cared. I 
    just wanted to be back on the boat.<p>
    During the afternoon we flew to Buenos Aires. We had more or less decided 
    that we should go to watch some Tango show when we got back to Buenos Aires, 
    that would be just after dinner. But in the bus, only 4 of us wanted to go 
    to Tango now. And as not more than 4 of us should go, the other 3 decided 
    not to go. And as I was the only one left that still wanted to go, I decided 
    that it would not be that nice to go there alone. So I also dropped the idea 
    at the end.<p>
    And after dinner, one person in our group wanted to walk home. I thought of 
    joining him, but while I was deciding, we started to drive. So when I 
    finally made up my decision, it was too late. I should have followed my 
    instinct right away and joined him.<p>
    2001-12-06<p>
    I was walking around in Buenos Aires for a while, sometimes with some people 
    from our group, sometimes alone. Buenos Aires seems very dull compared to 
    where I was a few days ago. I want to go back to Antarctica instead of being 
    here.<p>
    Many people thought the land/bed was rocking this day. I hope they got well 
    quite quick.<p>
    During the afternoon we went to the airport, and flew to Paris. Not a very 
    pleasant flight, but I got enough sleep (3-4 hours)<p>
    2001-12-07<p>
    We flew from Paris to Copenhagen.<p>
    At baggage area in Copenhagen, I met a colleague of mine. He had a rental 
    car, so I got a lift home. The lift home was a nice bonus, to two boring 
    days.</td>
