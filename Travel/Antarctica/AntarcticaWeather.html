    Weather in Antarctica<p>
    <img border="0" src="WeatherChange2.jpg" width="450" height="298" align="left">The 
    weather can change quite fast. From sunshine and a very nice day, to fog 
    and/or rain in a few (and I mean a few) minutes.<br clear="all">

        <p>
	<img border="0" src="ShipInStormWave2.jpg" width="450" height="303" align="left">Some 
    times it was a bit windy. Or should I say, most of the times it was quite 
    windy, and other times it was just storm and hurricane.</p>
        <p>
	When I was leaning on the ship railing, it was at the height of my chest. Do 
    the math, and figure out the height of the waves.<br clear="all">
&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>
	<img border="0" src="ShipInStormWave1.jpg" width="450" height="304" align="left">For 
    some reason we where not allowed to go the deck. &quot;It's not safe&quot; they said. 
    Nonsense...<br clear="all">

	<img border="0" src="ShipInStormAfterWave1.jpg" width="450" height="304" align="left">... 
    A little bit of water never hurt any one. The temperature of the water is 
    around -1 degree.</p>
	    <p>
	But you must admit, that this would have been a cool way of going fishing. 
    Just &quot;diving in with the ship&quot; and collecting a scoop of water.<br clear="all">
&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>
	<img border="0" src="ShipAfterSomeSnowing.jpg" width="450" height="306" align="left">Other 
    days, it was not slippery from stormy weather, but for other obvious 
    reasons. This is salt water that froze, and some snow.<br clear="all">
&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>
	<img border="0" src="LandscapeWithShip.jpg" width="450" height="305" align="left">But 
    all the bad weather made me appreciate good weather much more.</p>
	    <p>
	I was ready to board the zodiacs as one of the first people when we  arrived in Antarctica. I had no time to waste.</p>
	    <p>
	Quite often, I tried to stay behind, and take the last zodiacs back from 
    shore to the ship.</p>
	    <p>
	And after coming back, I felt like going up to the bridge (or actually 
    outside the bridge) to see some more of mother nature.<br clear="all">

	    <p>
	<img border="0" src="AckademikIofee.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="289">The 
    ship we called home this trip. This is a good picture for measurements. The 
    guy standing in the zodiac in the front, compared to the zodiac at the end 
    of the gangway, and the people walking down the gangway.</p>
	    <p>
	I guess that you get a feeling for how big the waves where in the above 
    pictures.<br clear="all">
&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>
	<img border="0" src="Landscape1.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">The 
    ocean is very nice when the sun is shining. I almost didn't care if it was 
    windy or not. It was just nice.<br clear="all">&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>
	<img border="0" src="BeachOnSaundersIsland.jpg" width="450" height="302" align="left">The 
    beach on Saunders Island. Paradise on earth. Why? Because it has Penguins, 
    and it's the most beautiful beach I have ever seen.<br clear="all">
