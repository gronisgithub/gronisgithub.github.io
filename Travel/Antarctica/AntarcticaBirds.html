    Black Browed Albatrosses<p>
    <img border="0" src="2BlackbrowedAlbatrossesOnTheGround.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="300">These 
    lovely birds are nesting on the Falkland Islands. They love their windy 
    islands, which enables them to take of with no effort.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="BlackbrowedAlbatrossInTheAir.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="318">Landing 
    is another matter. They slowly approaches their landing spot, and then 
    gently gently descends. Just before landing, they have to retract their 
    enormous wings. (Let's face it, there are not many landing spots that have 
    free space for their 3 meter wings.) During the retraction, they loose their 
    ability to gracefully maneuver in the air. So they (not so gracefully) crash 
    land.</p>

    This bird is searching below for a nice place to land, and in the meanwhile 
    he is almost perfectly still in the air.<br clear="all">

    Striated Caracara<p>
    <img border="0" src="StriatedCaracara.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="296">At 
    Saunders Island, these birds where awaiting our arrival. They kept their 
    distance (or we kept our distance), and they didn't seem too afraid of 
    humans. They almost looked like they wanted to be the pets of the natives.<br clear="all">
