    blue lagoon. Nice place to take a hot bath in. As the water is geothermal, 
    it will stay hot. Thankfully it's cold enough for us to enter. The water 
    here has lots of minerals. When you get out of the bath, and after you've 
    showered, your skin feels very strange. Very soft, and the minerals are very 
    hard to get rid of.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="HotSpringInBlueLagoon.jpg" width="450" height="554" align="left">As 
    you see, the water is quite warm, and filled with these white minerals.<p>
    The closer you went towards this spring, the warmer the water got. I had to 
    stop some 10 meters away, as it got too hot then.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="MeInBlueLagoon.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="304">This 
    lava stone is what the bottom of the blue lagoon is made of. But fortunately 
    a lot smoother. You still have to watch your step anyway, or you might cut 
    yourself on the rocks like I did. But bathing outside, when the air is +4 
    degrees feels strange. But if you stay in the water all the time you will be 
    too hot, so you have to go up to cool yourself. Imagine doing that in 
    Thailand or in Singapore.<br>
