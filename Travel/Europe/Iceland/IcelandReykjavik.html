    My dream has come true. This was one of the countries I really wished that I 
    could visit. The language here is very beautiful, and the Icelandic singer 
    Björk uses her native language in some songs. This was the second thing that 
    made me want to go here. The first thing was the nature. I wasn't let down 
    in any way by Iceland. It was better than I expected. Much better.<br>

    <img border="0" src="NormalCar.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="304">At 
    first look at this picture, this could have been shot in Switzerland, just 
    by a lake. However, this is not a lake, and very much colder than in 
    Switzerland. The car in the center of the picture is also very typical for 
    Reykjavik; Extremely big, and some of the largest wheels I've ever seen on a 
    car that can drive in the city.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="Church.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="676">On 
    Iceland, you have a mix of religions. Christianity, and the old Nordic 
    mythology.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="ReykjavikCity.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="302">The 
    beach of Reykjavik. I guess you don't go here for the nice white beaches, 
    but rather for the black lava-rocks that will act as the beach. As Reykjavik 
    is located in the coast of Iceland, you get a lot of seafood to choose from. 
    Lamb is also a very &quot;common&quot; dish, since they don't have to import lamb. I'm 
    really curious if they make Hamburgers or lamb burgers.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="VikingShip.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="296">If 
    you take a look at this sculpture from another angle you will see that this 
    looks like a Viking ship.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="BankiAndPostur.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="305">Bank 
    (Banki) and Post office (Postur) on the opposite sides of the street.<p>I 
    would say that this sums up quite much of how Icelandic is compared to 
    Swedish; Just add 'i' or 'ur' to the names, and you could very easily be 
    correct.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="StreetInReykjavik.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="304">The 
    nature is not co colorific, so they tend to create everything man made in 
    clear colours.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="InFrontOfHallgrimskirkja.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="665">The 
    not so small church acting as a landmark. To give you an impression of the 
    height, take a look at the next picture and compare this to the window that 
    you see in both pictures.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="InsideHallgrimskirkja.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="678">Inside 
    the church Hallgrimskirkja. The Icelandic people where originally Vikings, 
    so it's a quite young country. The religion of the Vikings is quite 
    different. They believed that if you died in battle, you would go to their 
    form of heaven (Valhalla). In there you fought during the whole day, and 
    partied at night. If you where killed during the daily battle in Valhalla, 
    you would be resurrected the next day, and you would go on fighting. This is 
    where every Viking wanted to go, so he practiced to be good at fighting as 
    much as he could, when he was alive.<br clear="all">

    company one amused me much. &quot;Odyrt Bensin&quot; - &quot;Non-expensive Petrol&quot;. Why not 
    have the name &quot;Cheap Gas&quot; instead? But if they would have had that name, I 
    would not have noticed it that much.<br clear="all">
