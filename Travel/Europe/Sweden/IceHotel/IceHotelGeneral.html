    <td valign="top" class="GRONISTEXT">I felt like getting really cold, so why 
    not spend the night in an Ice hotel? Well, if you know me well enough, you 
    know that I don't really like cold. But I like snow and ice, and snow often 
    requires cold temperatures. This is the coolest snow and ice creation I've 
    heard of, so I decided I wanted to go there. The hotel is located in a very 
    small village near Kiruna, northern Sweden.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    All I really knew before I went there was that I should bring warm clothes 
    (-5 degrees inside), and some thing thin to sleep in (inside a sleeping 
    bag). I also wanted to see the northern lights, but no such luck this time. 
    But, let's not waste any time. Let's enter the hotel, and see what can be 
    expected.<br>
    As can be seen on this picture the hotel is not 100% ice and snow, but close 
    enough. A few doors, and some lights and so on.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br>
    Inside the hotel you encounter many different Ice sculptures. Most of them 
    have some light source so it's easier to see them after sundown. Inside the 
    hotel it is bright enough, but not as bright as you are used to in your 
    home.<br>
    It was quite tricky to take photos here, as I was not sure how the flash 
    would affect the pictures. After looking at the end result, most of them 
    where best after using the flash, and shot for 3-5 seconds. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The hotel has it's own sauna. Actually 2 versions: 1 normal one, and 1 of 
    Ice, as seen on this picture. As you see some sculptures, like the above, 
    are not so elaborate as these &quot;rooms&quot;. You could find several beautiful 
    sculptures, and these are a few of them.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    As you see, it's the sets of sculptures that caught my eye at first. But 
    after a while, the feeling of actually walking in a hotel made of snow and 
    ice became the great feeling that kept me happy inside the hotel.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    A few lamps, but the rest of the wall is actually snow. Some ice pillars in 
    the middle of the alley, but I wonder if they really have any effect on the 
    stability of the walls. The ice is just as clear in these pillars, as in any 
    other part of the building.<br>

    This table with the chairs and the lamp, located in the center of the 
    hotel, caught most peoples eyes. This is the coldest chair I've ever sat on, 
    but also the most exquisite. You couldn't sit there for long.<br>

    If you instead chose a room to spend your night in, this is what they look 
    like. If you are able to sleep in the ice hotel, you will get a small 
    diploma.<br>
    <br>
    A bit of advice: Make sure you do not have a cold, or feel sick when going 
    here. The cold air will certainly not help you during night (as I found out 
    the hard way).<br>
    <br>
    Would I recommend anyone to go here? Yes, if you are not afraid of the 
    temperature outside (even colder than the indoor -5 degrees).<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    <br>
    Sleeping in the IceHotel is also an awesome experience.<br>
