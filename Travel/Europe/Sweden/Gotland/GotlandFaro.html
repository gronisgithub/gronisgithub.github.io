    <td valign="top" class="GRONISTEXT">The east coast of Gotland is supposed to be nice. So I went to Kattvik, and spent 
the night.<br>
In the morning, I got some more nice weather, and started to explore the east 
coast.<br>
However, I didn't find any thing that was so nice about the east coast. If you 
want to go<br>
swimming, then it could be easier to find some nice places. The beach is nice 
here, and<br>
not so many people here (as I was here off season). My advice to you would be to 
not waste<br>
your time to search for nice places on the east coast.<br>
<br>
After the disappointment with the east coast, I went to Fårön. I'd heard that 
there would<br>
be nothing to do. So how can I get disappointed with Fårön, If I have this in 
mind?<br>
The rumor I had heard was quite correct. Except for the thing that Gotland is 
famous for:<br>
Raukar. I only found these strange stones here. In the most northern part of 
Fårö; Which<br>
is the same as the most northern part of Gotland. These magnificent stones have 
a really<br>
nice, and strange, look to them. But most of them are not all that special. I've 
seen<br>
much nicer stone formations in Svalbard. But to compare it to the rest of the 
Swedish<br>
beaches, they look astonishing.<br>
<br>
The ferry between Fårön and the rest of Gotland takes 8 minutes, and leaves 
every<br>
30-60 minutes. Driving from the ferry to Visby takes around one hour.<p>While driving on the East Coast, I didn't see any car for 30 minutes. </p>
    <p>Nature wise, the landscape on Gotland looks like a mixture between the 2 Swedish landscapes Skåne and
Småland. Some parts are <span lang="sv">harvest fields</span>, and many parts are covered with woods and 
rocks.
If you are going to Gotland with a motorcycle, I would recommend the north east 
parts
(not including Fårö). Stay on the small roads, and you will have some really 
nice roads to
drive on.<br>
