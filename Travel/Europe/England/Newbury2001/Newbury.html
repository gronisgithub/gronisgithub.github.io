    <img border="0" src="MeInEnglishCar.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="305">I'm 
    trying to drive an English car. But whenever I want to change gears, my 
    right hand hits the door, and then I remember that I should use my left hand 
    to change gears.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="Fish'n'Chips.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="320">Classic 
    English meal. Fish 'n' Chips. And it tastes terrible. I just had to try it 
    several times when I was in England, to see that I didn't get the worst 
    possible restaurant. But they're all really bad.<p>And now I know that it 
    tastes bad, I don't have to try it again in several years.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="NewburyCenter.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">Town 
    center. Another typical English village. No better, no worse.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="StupidSignInTrain.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="626">This 
    sign in the train is however extremely stupid for several reasons:</p>
    <p>1. What's the problem with having a handle inside the train, instead of 
    having to open it with the outer handle?</p>
    <p>2. 'Do not lean out of the window'. And you clearly see the person 
    opening the door leaning outside to be able to open the door.</p>
    <p>The rest of the stupid things I will not comment on right now.<br clear="all">
