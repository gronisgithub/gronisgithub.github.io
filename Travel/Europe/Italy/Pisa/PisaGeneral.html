	<br>
	It has the Tower of Pisa, which is so famous for not standing straight.<br>
	<br>
	However, it looks like the tower is fairly straight, and I was a bit 
	confused when taking this photo.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="PisaTowerRight2566.jpg" width="450" height="673" align="left">And 
	then I took this photo, and it all made sense. This must be the worlds most 
	famous mistake. All they tried to do was to build a nice big bell tower, and 
	failed miserably with the fundamentals.<br>
	<br>
	And we tourists come from all over the world to look at this monument of 
	error.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="ANormalStreetInPisa2578.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Just 
	a normal street in Pisa. We where here on a Sunday, and this very Sunday was 
	the day of the Pisa Marathon. So all the streets where &quot;off limits&quot; to cars, 
	unless they where already there during the night. This is probably why the 
	city was not full of cars and busses.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="PisaInnerWall2583.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">I 
	guess that this is the inner wall in Pisa. As a tourist, you want to stay 
	within the boundaries of the wall.<br clear="all">
