	can't say that I have been too long in Bologna, but I can say that most of 
	the time spent in Bologna was in the Ducati factory and Museum.<p>The guided 
	tour of the factory is in English, and you can actually see them assembling 
	the bikes there. That's where the good parts stops.<br>
	The guide speaks very low, so you have to be in the forward 10% of the group 
	to hear what she says. And the tour is quite boring, as all parts are 3rd 
	party products, and just assembled here. No photos are allowed in there.</p>
	<p>During my visit, I didn't se a single yellow 999 in the factory, making 
	mine quite unique. Hurray.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="TCorser2606.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Troy 
	Corsers bike that he used in 96. The rear wheel even has the T.Corser logo 
	on it.</p>
	<p>After the tour you visit the museum which is quite nice for 10 minutes.</p>
	<p>Then you are allowed to buy souvenirs in the local shop. It's even more 
	expensive in this shop, than the local Ducati dealer in Sweden.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="Foggy2607.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">If 
	it wasn't for these bikes, I would have been very disappointed with the day, 
	as we drove here only to visit the Ducati factory.</p>
	<p>This is the bike that Foggy won with in 2002 and 2003, and It's very nice 
	to have seen it.</p>
	<p>If you are thinking of impressing Ducati with driving to the factory with 
	your (Ducati?) bike: Don't. They will not be impressed with anything but 
	your wallet.<br clear="all">
