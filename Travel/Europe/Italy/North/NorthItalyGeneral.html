	the north east of Italy, there are really many nice roads for Motorcycles.</p>
	<p>The small river on the left has really clear water, and it is very cold 
	as well. Just behind where I was standing, a couple where resting in the 
	sun, trying to get some color from the sun. Being there on the rocks looked 
	a bit strange, as they where wearing bathing suites.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="BikeRoad9908.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Another 
	nice road for bikers.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Pizzeria9931.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">The

	the alps.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="GreatBikingRoad9932.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Nice

    <img border="0" src="RoadSign9942.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">The

	enough, there is.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="AfterHailstorm2822.jpg" width="450" height="302" align="left">30 
	minutes after the above shot, the roof looked like this. There was a hail 
	storm appearing from nowhere, followed by some short rain. The streets and 
	roofs where covered in white hail.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="LagoMaggiore2831.jpg" width="450" height="230" align="left">The 
	small towns around Lago Maggiore reminds me of the small towns between 
	Geneva and Lausanne. Quite nice to spend a few hours in as a tourist.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="SmallIsland2825.jpg" width="450" height="184" align="left">But 
	there are some differences to the above mentioned towns in Switzerland: The 
	strange small islands in the middle of nowhere in the lake. I wonder how it 
	is on the island here.</p>
	<p>Oh well, I guess that I will never find out.<br clear="all">
