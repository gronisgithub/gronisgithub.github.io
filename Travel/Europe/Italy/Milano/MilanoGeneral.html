    <img border="0" src="DStoreMilano2938.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">The 
	reason for me to go to Milano: The Dainese D-Store. This is one of the stores 
	that has the most leather suites in different sizes.<p>Unfortunately I was a 
	bit disappointed here. I was hoping for quite much more suites to choose 
	from. But I guess 1-piece racing suites are not the best seller, so they 
	don't have it in stock.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="DstoreMilano2942.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">The 
	store is quite expensive, even compared to the store that is located a few 
	hundred meters from this one.</p>
	<p>I did learn a few things here. The D-Stores have their own special 
	edition of the suites. These suites are more expensive, and quite unique. 
	And these special editions where nicer than the mainstream colors.</p>
	<p>And I also learned that you could get your leather suite tailor made for 
	not much more money than the original. I guess I will try this if I choose 
	to switch later on.<br clear="all">

	here is another nice photo of Milan, instead of the normal street/houses 
	photos.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately there was no time to visit the city more than the leather 
	suite store.<br>
