    was the first thing i recognized when I arrived in Paris. The height of it, 
    and thickness was impressive. After looking at it, and it's sculptures I 
    started to look at the 6 lane round about. I soon understood that the round 
    about works in a complete different way in France than in Sweden. People 
    going out of the round about, has to break for the people entering the round 
    about. The exact opposite of Sweden. But they managed quite well. That was 
    the beginning of my observations on the differences between France and 
    Sweden.<br clear="all">
