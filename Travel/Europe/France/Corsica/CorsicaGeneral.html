    <img border="0" src="Arriving2624.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Arriving 
    here felt a bit like arriving in Gotland, but somewhat warmer.<p>
    Please remember that all these images have been modified more than usual to 
    look nice.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="NiceView2633.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">A 
    few minutes driving after arriving, and the town looks like this. Is this 
    laid back or what?<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Coast2643.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">The 
    coastal line is what makes Corsica famous. The diving and the scenery.<p>
    Just think twice before going there. It's quite expensive (more epensive 
    than monaco), and the scenic roads are narrow, and very slow. If you reach 50 
    km/h even once in one hour, consider yourself lucky.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Scenery2650.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Nice 
    landscape. But everything seems closed. Even the woods seem to be closed, 
    unless you take a closer look.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Coast2655.jpg" width="450" height="284" align="left">There 
    is a biker in red parked on the road, but they guess the got lost when 
    shrinking the image to web-size.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Coast2663.jpg" width="450" height="673" align="left">Yes, 
    it's a ship down there. It looks just amazing, but take a closer look at the 
    beach. Is this the beach you want to be at?<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="NotThatFarAway2668.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">This 
    gives more justice to Corsica. Hot, humid, and very much sun haze.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="BuildingInRock2679.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Cool 
    building. Too bad it's a closed factory.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheHarbor2686.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">The 
    harbor in Calvi. Quite well adapted for tourists, and as there is nowhere 
    else to eat, the food is quite expensive.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="CorsicaLeNautic2688.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">The 
    food is not only expensive at Le Nautic in Calvi. It also makes the second 
    worst pizza I have ever tried. The downside of this is that it was the most 
    expensive I have ever tried, so it didn't improve the situation.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="CalviTouristCenter2689.jpg" width="450" height="673" align="left">A 
    few meters from the water line, you can find this nice alley. Custom made 
    for families, as they sell only bathing things, and postcards at a high 
    price.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="RoadsOnCorsica2721.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Just 
    a reminder: The roads are not the best. They all look like this along the 
    coast. Worn, slow and sometimes dangerously steep. We saw a few cars that 
    didn't make it, and they where lying far away.<br clear="all">
