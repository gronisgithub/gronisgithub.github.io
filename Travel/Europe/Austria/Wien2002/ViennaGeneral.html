    <img border="0" src="BirdsAtSchönbrunn.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="302">My 
    trip started at the castle of Schönbrunn. I imagined castles to look quite 
    different than this one.<br>
    So I decided to try to take some different types of photos on the birds.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="BirdsAtSchönbrunn2.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">The 
    black thing behind this bird is actually snow. White snow. You wouldn't have 
    thought that, now would you?<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ChristmasMarketAtSchönbrunn.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">The 
    Christmas market at Schönbrunn. Reminds me of how my home village when I was 
    very young.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TreesWithFrost.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">The 
    weather was very different from day to day. But these trees looks great when 
    the fog is freezing, and sticking to the branches.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="HousesOnHill.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">To 
    me, this is very typical houses on the hills of Austria. This is just 
    outside Vienna.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="RoofPaintingStiftMelk.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">At 
    Stift Melk you can see these wonderful paintings in the roof, and on may 
    outside walls. I can only imagine of how it looks inside.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="StiftMelk.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">Looking 
    at Stift Melk, and it's gardens. Makes a very nice photo, but this is too 
    small to look great.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="RollerCoasterAndRiesenrad.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">One 
    of the &quot;roller coasters&quot; in the Prater. In the background you see the 
    Riesenrad Ferris wheel. <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Boomerang-Hangover-Rollercoaster.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">Looks 
    very similar to the one we have in Sweden. And from this angle it looks like 
    a big smile.<br>
    When I was there, it was closed. Very likely because it was way to cold to 
    enjoy a ride in it.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Stephansdom.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="673">Stephansdom says.... welcome?<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="InsideStephansdom.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="673">At 
    least the inside looks more appealing than the outside.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="StephansdomCatacomb.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">Underneath 
    the Stephansdom church, you find the Catacombs. And these photos here are 
    from the nicer parts of the Catacombs.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="StephansdomCatacomb2.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">For 
    some strange reasons, they keep parts of saints in these jars/boxes. Why 
    would you like to store parts of really old humans, in jars underneath a 
    church?<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="HorseAndCarrigeAtStephansdo.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">Tourist

    <br>
    <img border="0" src="HouseOfMozart.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="673">This 
    is where Mozart lived in Vienna. Very nice that they still keep his 
    apartment.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="DerKiosk.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">Just 
    a funny picture. The name of the store is: &quot;The kiosk&quot;. Plain and simple.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Statue.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="673">I 
    really wonder why this statue is there, and what it represents.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="StreetInVienna.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="673">A 
    typical street in Vienna with many apartments. This is from the 1st district 
    (i.e. the city center)<br clear="all">
