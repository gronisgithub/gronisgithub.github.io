    Singapore,
    2001-02<p>This is the closest I've ever been to the equator. Hot, humid, and 
    Air-condition.</p>
    <p>
    <img border="0" src="BotanicalGarden1.jpg" width="450" height="304" align="left">The 
    botanical garden is very nice in Singapore. Lots of colors, nicely arranged 
    and well kept.</p>
    <p>
    The diversity of what you can eat in Singapore is grand. As I mostly 
    preferred Chinese food, that's what I tried to get as much as possible of. 
    Fortunately I made a new friend in Singapore, and she took me to many great 
    places. I experienced most of Singapore with my new friend. Also another 
    friend I met in Bangkok, that lives in Singapore showed me the great places 
    in Singapore, like the botanical garden.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ButterflyOnMyHand.jpg" width="450" height="294" align="left">This 
    butterfly found me interesting and landed on my hand. When I shook it off, 
    it went back there. It really had a thing for me.<br clear="all">
    <br>

    <br>
    <img border="0" src="BotanicalGardenTree.jpg" width="450" height="661" align="left">Behind 
    my other friend here, a very large tree is standing. To me, this is a very 
    very large tree.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="BotanicalGardenTallTrees.jpg" width="450" height="664" align="left">Why 
    is everything so tall here? Is gravity malfunctioning slightly, or what?<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="SingaporeCenter.jpg" width="450" height="300" align="left">Singapore 
    is said to be the cleanest country you could ever visit. But I didn't find 
    it that extremely clean. The places I've been to in Phuket (Thailand), and 
    Shanghai was just as clean. Sure, the cars had a high standard here compared 
    to the other places I mentioned.<br>
    All these laws Singapore has, like not spitting on the sidewalk, and they 
    still haven't got any law for seatbelt in the backseat of the car. This is 
    to me a bit twisted: First make sure that the city is clean, and then try to 
    save lives.</p>
    <p>
    Anyhow, Singapore is well worth a visit. Many things would not look good on 
    any photo, so that's a reason why I don't have many pictures here.<br>
    <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="WorldsLargestWaterFountain.jpg" width="450" height="297" align="left">The 
    worlds largest water fountain. Was this created merely to be a tourist 
    attraction, do you think?<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="BuildingOutlines.jpg" width="450" height="304" align="left">During 
    night, the buildings are still clearly visible. Not only because of the 
    windows, but also because of the outlining lights.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="CautionWorkInProgress.jpg" width="450" height="323" align="left">The 
    sign says: &quot;Caution&nbsp; Work in progress&quot;.</p>
    <p>
    Caution? It sounds like &quot;be ware&quot;, as in &quot;be ware - something terrible is 
    going on&quot;. Is work really that bad?<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Dining3MetersFromTheOcean.jpg" width="450" height="304" align="left">To 
    me, this is closer to paradise. Sitting at dinner with my friend, and part 
    of her family. This local restaurant is just by the beach. I was the only 
    tourist here. They introduced me to Malaysian food, and this was nothing 
    like the food I tried in Kuala Lumpur. It was very good.</p>
    <p>
    I hope to see my friend again soon, and see more of Singapore.<br>
