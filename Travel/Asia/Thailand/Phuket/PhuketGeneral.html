    Thailand, Phuket, 1999-01<p>
    <img border="0" src="PatongBeach.jpg" width="450" height="303" align="left">In January -99, I took a trip over to Phuket in Thailand. When leaving the 
    airplane, the heat in the air struck you immediately. And that is my first 
    impression of Thailand. Hot. To give you a view of how hot, then imagine 
    yourself entering your parked car in the summer, and it has been standing in 
    the sun for 3 hours. Now instead of having the doors open, and the fans on 
    maximum cooling - close the doors and turn on the heat in the car. After a 
    while, you get the feeling. The only difference is that the heat in Thailand 
    is bearable, since the air is very humid.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="Phuket1.jpg" width="450" height="303" align="left">My second impression is that the people are very friendly. And the 
    friendliness is not fake like in the US. This friendliness is genuine. If 
    you or they make a fool of yourself, it's always followed by laughter from 
    their side to show you that making a fool of your self is part of life, and 
    that you should enjoy life. This is also reflected in their driving. They 
    don’t have any other rule but this: largest goes first. They don't seem to 
    have any hurry in the traffic (except the Europeans that rents cars). The 
    important thing for them is getting there, and not risking their life for 2 
    minutes. Sure the roads are packed, but no-one is looking angry in the 
    traffic. After getting used to the first shocking encounter with the 
    traffic, you feel quite safe, even though you're not wearing any seatbelt.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="SmallWoodenBoats.jpg" width="450" height="306" align="left">The scenery is the greatest that I've seen. Cliffs going straight into the 
    water, or a small mountainside gently descending into the water. Tanzania 
    was great with its great open field, but this is breathtaking. Makes me feel 
    like I want to swim over, and climb the mountainside all the way. The only 
    thing that is destroying the view of this great scenery when driving is the 
    horrible high-voltage lines arranged along the road. Otherwise I could have 
    close to a hundred more great scenery pictures. The reason I like mountains 
    is probably because that I don't have any mountains close to where I live.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="IHaveBeenDiving.jpg" width="450" height="307" align="left">I was also scuba diving in Thailand. I just wanted to try it and see if this 
    was for me. So I signed up for PADI open water certificate. After the 
    theory, it was time to try diving in the swimming pool. After that it was 
    time to try the real thing. I felt very unsure about myself here, but after 
    the fist few dives it was easier to regulate the air in the vest, so I would 
    not go up and down like a roller coaster. After getting the certificate, I 
    felt I needed more training on this (especially since I ran out of air on 
    one dive, but I was close to the surfaces so it was just to swim up to the 
    surface) so why not sign up for the PADI advanced open water certificate. 
    This would expand my knowledge, and give me some more training.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="Fish1.jpg" width="450" height="304" align="left">I got the opportunity to take underwater photos, and man - is that hard or 
    what. Here are my best shots, but I still don’t think that they come close 
    the photos from the Serengeti. At least I got the practice I needed, and now 
    I feel more sure with myself, in the aspect of diving.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="MeAfterDive.jpg" width="450" height="576" align="left">It's a long way from riding your bike, which is about 100 times faster. You 
    don't swim much more than 2 km/h to save air/energy, and to have time to see 
    all the interesting animal and plant-life under the surface.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="PatongBeach2.jpg" width="450" height="304" align="left">This is one place that I can recommend to go on vacation if you like heavy 
    exploited tourist sites, and then you should go to many of the tours that I 
    didn't go to. The pirate-copied wristwatches and clothes are very cheap and 
    have a fair quality (I haven't found anything to complain about).<br>
