    Thailand, Bangkok, 1999-08<p>
    This was my first stop in Asia, and my first real contact with the Thai 
    people. The weather in Bangkok was quite good, since I like it hot. I'm from 
    Sweden - what do you expect? The weather in Sweden is cold and windy. 
    Compared to Thailand's weather which is warm, humid and still. The exact 
    opposite of Swedish weather. <br>
    <br>
    The people where just as friendly as I had imagined (since my visit in 
    Phuket). And the food is just as good. Actually, the food is really good all 
    over Asia. Lots of different new things to try. Although I did not want to 
    try pig stomach etc. My recommendation is to try all the local food you can. 
    You've probably heard this over and over, but - I think that experiencing 
    the food in all its variations will give you a greater experience of the 
    country. <br>
    <br>
    Shopping for fake things in Thailand is famous. It's so cheap. Things you 
    should buy in Thailand: T-shirts, ladies dresses, belts, wristwatches. You 
    can almost always get the thing you want for less than half the price they 
    ask for. Normally between 30-50% of the original price. How to get the price 
    down is up to you. <br>
    <br>
    The first time I saw Star wars Episode I was at The Emporium in Bangkok. The 
    theatre was one of my all time favorites. Huge screen, incredible sound 
    system and just the right price. That's to say, the right price for me; the 
    locals think that this is really expensive, but to us Europeans it's cheap. 
    I would have spent a lot more to see Episode I. And since it was so cheap 
    and excellent theatre, I decided to see it again, 2 days later here.<br>
    Which other movies did I see in Asia?? None.<br clear="all">
