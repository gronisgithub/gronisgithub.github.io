    <img border="0" src="Jerusalem1.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="309">These people live in the middle of their

    gone. Since they are human, they are reluctant to accept anything that is 
    different. To do that you have to learn how to do that, and some people are 
    not willing to do this. So if something is different or strange, we tend to 
    try to dispose of these elements, so that we can live in peace and unity. I 
    don't disagree with this, but it has to be kept to a certain level, and some 
    people have crossed the line in the worst possible way. It could be easy for 
    us to say, why don't they just live together. Then I ask you, don't you know 
    any one that is a racist? Your first task should then be to change that 
    person, since he/she is a lot closer to you, compared to the people in 
    Israel. Se how easy that is, and then imagine that some of the people that 
    you first wanted to change can be ten times more difficult to change. Are 
    you up to the task?<br>

        <img border="0" src="Church1.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="661">Jerusalem is a beautiful old city with it's culture and religion well 
    preserved. Just because the city is dirty, doesn't mean that is can't be 
    beautiful. And since there's a constant stream of tourists, the society has 
    changed to be able to handle the tourists. Lots of sales people, wanting to 
    sell &quot;junk&quot; to you for prices you never imagined; you've never seen so many 
    figures on a price tag before. Exactly the opposite of Thailand, where you 
    can buy everything you feel like. But the sales people are just as good as 
    the ones in Thailand, so they always find one or two &quot;victims&quot; in the crowd 
    to sell their things to. A word of advice - don't have eye-contact with 
    anyone of them, or you'll never get rid of them.<br clear="all">

        <img border="0" src="YardInChurch1.jpg" width="450" height="661" align="left">I was at the place where Jesus was born, crucified, and the street he walked 
    up to his crucifixion. I'm not convinced that these where the actual sites, 
    but to me this was as good as any. The real place of Jesus birth should not 
    be just another tourist attraction. It's too sacred to have as a tourist 
    place to me. I don't think that I'm the only one, thinking like this. But 
    what do know for sure is the real one, is the western wall I got the 
    opportunity to go and touch the wall. This was almost as exciting then, as 
    when I went and touched the outside wall of the forbidden city in Beijing. 
    The western wall was filled with small notes, of peoples wishes. They where 
    not allowed to remove any notes. Also no appliances to get the note to stick 
    where allowed, so the only way was to fold their note, and try to press it 
    down between some other notes. If you where lucky, you could press your note 
    down one of the cracks in the wall.<br>

    but you never realize how big it is until you are inside it. Well worth a 
    visit. And as always you are covered with religion once you enter. If you 
    get lucky, you can actually see the monks.<br clear="all">

        <img border="0" src="WesternWall.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="307">The 
        Western Wall. One of the most famous walls in the world. You pray here, 
        and try to insert small notes of your wishes into the wall, without 
        removing the other peoples notes. This way your wish may come true.<br>
        I didn't try to insert any note for 2 reasons. I had nothing right then 
        to wish for that I could think of, and I didn't feel accidentally 
        removing the wish of one person.<br clear="all">

    The day in Jerusalem was very interesting, and exciting. The day after I was 
    there, I read in the paper that one man had shot 7 other people in a street, 
    not too far from us. We had not noticed anything, so it might have happened 
    after we left.<br>
