    Israel, Tel Aviv, 1999-01<p>
    Tel Aviv is a very busy, high tech city. I always assumed that they only had 
    ruins and guns there. Shows how much I know, doesn't it?<br>
    <br>
    Whenever you're there, you should go to the lookout point. This enables you 
    to see all over the great city, and on a clear night it really astounds you. 
    Most lookout points do, I agree, but this one is definitely better than the 
    normal ones.<br>
    <br>
    The beach is also very good, and can be recommended. If you are from a cold 
    area (like Sweden), you will have no problem swimming in the ocean during 
    winter. It's hot enough.<br>
    <br>
    The inhabitants tend to go out for dinner a lot later than the other places 
    I've been to. To them 11 PM seems to be the normal time go to dinner, and 
    the places are packed with people. I don't know how they manage. Totally the 
    opposite of the US. I can't really tell if the local food is good or not, 
    since I did not dare to try it. Stupid me. I have myself to blame.<br>
    <br>
    One thing I was jealous of was that they had fresh strawberries at winter, 
    and we normally have strawberries during midsummer. As you see, I was not 
    completely wrong when I told you that you can go swimming in winter in Tel 
    Aviv.<br>
    <br>
    When we where out one night, we started to talk about the differences 
    between Israeli and Swedish people. Again they said that Swedish people are 
    very calm, and listens patiently to other people. I guess that I have to 
    take their word for it.<br>
    <br>
    They told us that it is the law to have Air-condition in your car. 
    Presumably they have had too many accidents because people are tired after 
    work, and it gets worse if you sit in a hot car. All you want to do is get 
    home as fast as possible, and your temper rises with the temperature. So the 
    accidents have dropped since they all have the possibility to have a nice 
    cool car.<br>
    Another strange thing is that the police cars has to drive with their lights 
    on all the time. So how do you know if you're being pulled over? <br clear="all">
