    India, Agra, 2003-02<p>
    <img border="0" src="RecyclingPart1.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">India 
    has a very strange recycling system.</p>
    <p>
    First we eat our lunch or dinner (with the fingers). Then they collect the 
    trays (along with everything on it) again.<br>
    When that is done, they remove the serving tray, and throw everything else 
    out the door. Paper, plastic, aluminum, food.</p>
    <p>
    A few seconds later, the first dog arrive, and start feeding. A minute 
    later, there are a few dogs, and they fight over the food.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="RecyclingPart2.jpg" width="450" height="673" align="left">After 
    the dogs have eaten what they can, a boy show up. He is collecting the 
    aluminum, in which we had our lunch, sauce and more. My guess is that he 
    then can sell it for a few rupees per kilo.</p>
    <p>
    But nobody picks up the plastic or the paper. That's why India looks like a 
    big dump.</p>
    <p>
    So India has some sort of recycling system, but not the most effective.</p>
    <p>
    If only the boy could get some rupees for the plastic and paper as well, 
    then India would probably be a lot cleaner (at least look cleaner) than 
    today.</p>
    <p>
    <a href="TrainNoise.mp3">Here's a recording of the noise in the train</a>. 
    This is the noise level of the most expensive class. The common class has a 
    different noise... </p>
    <p>
    The person selling coffee also has a strange sound. He always repeats 
    himself. Even when standing still and pouring the coffee to someone, he 
    never stops. Also when giving change, or getting money, this is all he ever 
    says. Never thank you or any other word. Just
    <a href="Coffi-Coffi-Coffi.mp3">Coffi-Coffi-Coffi</a>.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TVWithVoltageRegulator.jpg" width="450" height="673" align="left">At 
    this hotel, we even got a TV.</p>
    <p>
    What is funny about this, is how It's connected. The cable goes from the 
    socket in the wall, to a Voltage regulator at the bottom. And from that to 
    the TV.</p>
    <p>
    I guess that it's connected to this, to remove the constant power spikes 
    that India has. The TV would probably not liver very long without it. But as 
    we didn't select an expensive room, there was no UPS, to accompany the 
    Voltage regulator.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TajMahalClassicView.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">And 
    the goal of the 2600 km (36 hours) long train ride from Goa to Agra: Taj 
    Mahal.</p>
    <p>
    I just had to take this classic view of the Taj Mahal.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TajMahalOtherView.jpg" width="450" height="292" align="left">And 
    they where repairing the Taj on many places at the same time.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TajMahalMyView.jpg" width="450" height="673" align="left">The 
    Taj is quite large, and it looks better on photo than in reality.</p>
    <p>
    There are 2 different entry fees to the Taj. 150 rupees for Indians, and 750 
    for foreigners.</p>
    <p>
    As they have &quot;adapted&quot; to tourism, why does the locals behave as we where 
    the first tourists that they have ever seen.</p>
    <p>
    We tried to find something that resembles the average Agra person.<br>
    The closest resemblance is: if you mix a bad/naughty kid, and a monkey, this 
    is very close.<br>
    I have never had to degrade a person to the intelligence/social competence 
    to a kid before, but in this case, it was not enough. You had to degrade 
    even further. I don't like it, but in my mind, it's the closest I can come 
    up with.</p>
    <p>
    After spending 4 hours at the Taj, it was time to think about returning to 
    Goa.<br>
    Was it worth 2 x 36h train for 4 hours of Taj. I guess so. Because there was 
    not much for us to do in Goa.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="MenHoldingHands.jpg" width="450" height="673" align="left">Another 
    very strange habit that the Indian men have, are that they are holding hands. 
    Just like some small kids do here in Sweden, the Indian men are holding 
    hands to show their friendship. Another proof that Indians are more like 
    kids than grownups.</p>
    <p>
    A very high percentage of the men also has a mustache. My guess is that they 
    all think that it looks really good.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="GreyRiverAndGreenLeaves.jpg" width="450" height="673" align="left">After 
    leaving the Taj, we where walking around in the city. Bad Idea, but we 
    didn't know any way else to spend the time. As soon as we went out of the 
    Taj, the extreme staring started again. And everywhere we went, Everyone was 
    shouting &quot;hello, hello, hello&quot;. And the best thing we could do was to 
    completely ignore everyone. It's very hard to do, as you always have around 
    20-200 pair of eyes focused on you, where ever you go.</p>
    <p>
    A kid on a bike also tried to steal my coca cola from my hands. He was 
    cycling towards me, and reached out his hand to try to grab it. Fortunately 
    he was coming from front, and he was staring at my coca cola. So I had no 
    trouble seeing what he was going to do, a few seconds before he reached me.<br>
    I grabbed the coke with both hands, and he was so busy staring at the coke, 
    that he didn't notice that I saw him.<br>
    When he grabbed his hand around the coke, I grabbed his hand, and yanked it. 
    As he was cycling, he didn't manage to keep the bike straight. In some 
    miraculous way he didn't fall and hurt himself. Instead the bike fell, and 
    he landed on his feet. Scared he ran very fast away from there, leaving his 
    bike.</p>
    <p>
    After that incident, we walked out to less populated areas for a while.</p>
    <p>
    Then we found this.<br>
    Grey river. Not brown, nor clear. Grey like full of cement. And anyhow the 
    leaves on the trees were very green. It seems that nature is colorblind, and 
    will use any water it can :-)<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="SixPeopleInAMopedTaxiMadeForTwo.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Everywhere 
    in India, you find these &quot;moped taxis&quot;. The driver is supposed to sit in 
    front, and 2 passengers in the back.<br>
    The driver has 2 rear view mirrors, but they are not used for looking at the 
    traffic. They are used to look at the customers, when he is talking.</p>
    <p>
    But as many people in India are quite poor, they always use every resource 
    to the max. Here 6 people are using the taxi, and that was a quite common 
    sight. 5-7 was the normal amount of passengers that these taxis had, when 
    they where not driving non-Indian tourists.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="RedAndWhiteMarkingsOnTrees.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">The 
    red and white markings are there for two reasons. The markings contain 
    substance to keep away insects from harming the trees. And the contrast 
    color make them easier to see when it's dark.</p>
    <p>
    The last argument I would understand if this was a road where people could 
    drive with cars, but this road is only for cycling and walking.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ElecricalWiring.jpg" width="450" height="673" align="left">Another 
    beautiful picture of the sunset. And along with that, the proof again of 
    Indian ingenuity.</p>
    <p>
    While we where in the train, we also saw some great wiring. Several normal 
    (like this) poles connected to each other in a long row. But at one end, all 
    the wires where just hanging. Not connected to anything. I was searching for 
    another pole in the extended imaginary line in the direction the other poles 
    lead. But I could not find any pole. So the wires had not been cut off by 
    any falling tree (there where no trees within 100m of any of the poles). The 
    wires had just ended there. For no apparent reason.</p>
    <p>
    In Agra I also saw the most disgusting thing I have ever seen in my life:</p>
    <p>
    The public toilets in Agra consists of 3 walls, and a hole. And under the 
    toilets, and along the street, there was a channel. In this channel, some 
    viscous fluid was running, of human excrement.<br>
    This is all well, as they had some form of sewage system. But! This worked 
    only well, until we reached the point where the street was not sloping. At 
    that point, all of what was in the channel was creating a small lake. And in 
    this lake, some pigs where walking/wading.<br>
    I'm glad that I'm not a pig, and I'm glad that I'm not living in india.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="WashingAndBathing.jpg" width="450" height="300" align="left">When 
    going back to Goa with the train, I saw many people washing clothes and 
    bathing. But this was the only time I actually saw men presumably washing 
    clothes. Otherwise it was only the colorful women that where doing all the 
    washing. The men where just bathing. And occasionally the men would also be 
    fishing.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ColorfulWomenInShadowOfTree.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Colorful 
    women resting in the shadow of a tree. Surrounded by garbage of paper and 
    plastic.</p>
    <p>
    Before sitting down, I observed one lady finding a large enough piece of 
    plastic. Then she tried to make it somewhat clean, and used it to sit on.<br clear="all">
