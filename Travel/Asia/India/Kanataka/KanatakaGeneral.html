    <img border="0" src="SugerCainJuice.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">This 
    is a very local thing. Sugar cane juice. All they do to produce the sugar 
    cane juice is to insert a few canes in the press, and out comes some fluid.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="StandardTrainCarLotsOfFans.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">On 
    our way to watch the tigers, we had to go on a very local train. It has the 
    cheap way of air-condition: Old reliable fans, open doors and windows. The 
    seats are quite small. 3 people on seats that we would think are designed 
    for 2.</p>
    <p>
    The guy, in the blue shirt on the lower left part of the picture, didn't 
    seem to have seen any European before. He and his friends where constantly 
    staring at us for 4 hours. The last half hour of the train, they played 
    card, and didn't stare so much at us then.</p>
    <p>
    But one of the guys in that group was standing and looking at us with a pair 
    of binoculars. As you see, it's not very far away...<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="IndianTigerFace.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">After 
    about 24 hours of travel, we finally came to the tigers. The national park 
    is called &quot;Teverekopa&quot; or similar.</p>
    <p>
    What a disappointment. They where kept in cages (no roof on the cage, but 
    anyhow), measuring 500m x 1000m. The deer (tiger food) where kept a large 
    distance away from the tigers.</p>
    <p>
    So 48 hours of traveling for 20 minutes of tigers in cages was not what I 
    expected, when I signed up for the &quot;Tiger tour&quot;.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="IndianTiger.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">And 
    to add to the damage, I accidentally overwrote 250 of my photos. On those 
    photos where where I got the great photos of the tigers. So not even these I 
    got home with me.</p>
    <p>
    All in all: a very disappointing trip.<br clear="all">

    lion in another cage, resting in the shadow (just like tigers was).<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="StrikersStoppingTheTrain.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">On 
    our way back from watching tigers in a cage, Strikers where stopping the 
    train. At first I got really scared, because they seemed very upset and 
    violent. However, they felt happy with them selves, just by stopping the 
    train. So there was no actual danger. Lucky for me.</p>
    <p>
    They where striking against that the price of Diesel had gone up.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="RailwayWorkersTakingABreak.jpg" width="450" height="673" align="left">Around 
    lunchtime, when it was extremely hot, the railway workers where taking a 
    break.</p>
    <p>
    But when they didn't have a break, they where working very very close to the 
    train. The train slowed down to around 30km/h, but the workers where still 
    hacking in the ground, only a meter from the rail. Not very safe, but it's 
    their ways.</p>
    <p>
    A railway worker makes around 150 rupees per day, for their hard work. This 
    is equivalent to €3/day.</p>
    <p>
    1½ liters of coca cola costs 35 rupees.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="FishermanInHisBoat.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Whenever 
    we saw a river, there was always much life (compared to everywhere else).</p>
    <p>
    With the river, came green trees, and the possibility to grow crops. So 
    there where always Green trees, People with houses and farms, animals, cows, 
    close to the rivers.</p>
    <p>
    Also fishing was a big part of generating food and income to the family. I 
    was surprised how much fish was in these dirty rivers. Very small fish (7 cm 
    maximum), but still fish that the locals eat.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="MoreStrikersStoppingTheTrain.jpg" width="450" height="301" align="left">Another 
    strike, and people stopping the train, in protest of the raising diesel 
    price.</p>

    The soil was always very red in Goa, as there is very much iron in the soil.<br clear="all">
