    Beijing, 1999-08<p>The magnificent Great Wall.</p>
    <p>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall1.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="299">This 
    used to be the absolute greatest thing I've ever seen, before I went to 
    Antarctica. The only thing close was all the Wildebeests in Serengeti.<br>
    You see it on postcards, you read about it. Still, the sight of it is really 
    astounding. You can't believe that humans actually built this.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall2.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="627">Imagine 
    this scenario: Mongolians wants to invade some small cities in China. So 
    they march towards those villages for a long time, in this terrible 
    landscape (terrible to march in, great to look at). Lots of Mountains that 
    are all covered with forest. Not the ideal place to try to rush at. It also 
    makes you exhausted after just a few hours. After a few weeks of marching to 
    the cities, you know that you must be close. Just when you watch over the 
    closest mountain, you see a strange sight. A wall! It doesn't look big from 
    where you are standing, so you think that that's a piece of cake. The closer 
    you get the larger the wall gets. And everywhere you look, you see the wall. 
    And to get to any part of the wall you have to climb up a mountainside. 
    Finally you reach it, and realize that there is no way around it. Looking 
    up, trying to figure out if you can climb over it. Only a glance is enough 
    to determine that you'd rather hitchhike with an alien to the moon. That's 
    easier. But the general has ordered you to climb over it. When you start 
    climbing, you see a few guards standing on the wall, just looking at you. 
    You know that they have an easy job getting you off the wall, if you should 
    succeed, by some miracle, to get half way. In this situation, there is 
    nothing on your mind, other than giving up. So you give up. What else is 
    there?<br clear="all">

    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall4.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="302">Imagine 
    the strength and endurance the workers must possess to build a huge stone 
    wall. They build it on the highest place on a mountain side, and in the 
    middle of a dense forest. So to make sure that your enemies can't use trees 
    to climb over, you have to make the wall really tall, and also clear away 
    all trees that are close by. The wall is quite wide too. There is not 
    problem walking 5, side by side, on the wall. It's also very steep. The only 
    comfort is that you know that your enemies will have it a lot more difficult 
    than you. The only thing more difficult than building it, is to conquer it.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="TheGreatWall7.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">One 
    thing I have come to reflect at is: The wall doesn't change. It looks 
    exactly the same on TV as the first time you saw it. For generations, the 
    wall has prevailed. It has remained while wars has been fought and 
    forgotten. It seems to be forever, but we all know that nothing is forever. 
    This wall is, however, as close as you get. It seems just as eternal as the 
    mountains.<br clear="all">
