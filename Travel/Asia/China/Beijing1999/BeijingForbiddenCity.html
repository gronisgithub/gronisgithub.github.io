    <img border="0" src="ForbiddenCity04.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="302">It 
    had more than 6000 inhabitants when it was forbidden. The walls around it 
    could easily be 50 meters thick. So, yes - it's forbidden. Well worth a 
    visit when you are in Beijing. Lots of Chinese culture. On the buildings 
    there where some figures. To find out how holy a building was, all you had 
    to do was to count the figures on the end of the roof. The highest number 
    was 9, except where the emperor slept. It had 10 figures, indication the 
    holiest of all holy places. Nobody except him where allowed inside. The 
    buildings almost always goes on red and yellow. The classic Chinese red any 
    yellow, that is.<br>

    <img border="0" src="ForbiddenCity05.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="298">The 
    thing I miss when walking there are the &quot;original inhabitants&quot;.<br>
    What I means is: imagine walking around in New York. There are nobody 
    working there, nobody living there. The only people there are tourist for 
    the day. Then you start thinking of how it must have been for the people 
    living there, and all the questions that you wanted to ask them.<br>
    Anyway, This way is better than not seeing it, and it is one of the greatest 
    places in the world to visit.<br clear="all">
