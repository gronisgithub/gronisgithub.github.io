    China, Shanghai, 1999-08<p>
    I&nbsp;did not find too many interesting places to visit here. <br>
    <br>
    However the local food here is highly recommended. As I might have said 
    before, I wanted to try all the local food, and as many local customs as 
    possible when I was out travelling. This brought me to a local shop, just a 
    few steps from our office. My friends told me that they serve dumplings 
    there. As I had no idea of what dumplings where, so I said OK - I'd love to. 
    As we went in to the shop, the 3 servants where really raising their 
    eye-brows. Since there where only 5 tables in the shop, there where no way 
    to avoid their staring eyes. I sat down, and after a while we got the 
    dumplings.<br>
    It looks terrible. Just a soup with big chunks of dough in it. The look can 
    be described as looking at a 3 day old water pool with some white chunks, 
    roughly the size of half your fist. I.e. it looked tasteless. But I had to 
    try it. Biting in to the first white chunk, the water from the soup burned 
    me. As I reacted to the heat of the soup, I saw the servants giggling to my 
    reaction. I had to give it another try, and this time it worked fine. I 
    really tasted good. The soup is as far away from tasteless as you can get. 
    Highly recommended.<br>
    <br>
    Later the servants told my colleague that I was the first foreigner in their 
    shop in their long history. That would explain their interest in me. Of 
    course they wanted to know how I found my dumplings, and I told them that I 
    liked it very much. So whenever you are in Shanghai, I would recommend the 
    local food here. My favourite is chicken/noodle soup. Things like these are 
    very hard to find back home. You never get quite the same as the local tase 
    of the food. No matter how hard you try.<br>
    <br>
    Just a few steps away from my hotel was an indoor go-cart track. It looked 
    quite nice, and the cars seemed to go very fast, so I descided to give it a 
    try.<br>
    2 of my co-workers joined me, and some local guys. The race was quite fun, 
    and I found myself knowing the track after only a little while. To add to my 
    excitement, I lapped the guy that came in 2nd, and I lapped the girl that 
    came in last 5 times. A very good way to get me happy. Go-cart is always 
    fun. I still prefer outdoor carts, but I will not hesitate too much before 
    driving anywhere.<br>
    <br>
    If you feel like going shopping for CDs, you should be ware that the CDs 
    here will have holes in them. This because they are originals that has been 
    rejected at the factory for some reason. Most of them works anyway though. 
    Price here is the same as in Beijing. The place to buy them are at Hua Ting 
    Lu.<br>
    <br>
    Outside my hotel, there where a lot of people doing their morning exercise 
    (Tai Chi). It seems very popular in china to have a common exercise. Again, 
    in China, you don't have any personal life; it's a part of their culture. <br clear="all">
