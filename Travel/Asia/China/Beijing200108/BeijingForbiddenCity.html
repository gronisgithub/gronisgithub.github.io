    Located at the far end of Thiamin Square, you find The Forbidden City. 
    Luckily it's not forbidden for us tourists to visit now days.<p>As I was 
    here a few years earlier, I'm writing some other comments about this city 
    now.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    This 
    is part of the old wall surrounding the Forbidden City.</p>
    <p>
    <img border="0" src="ForbiddenCity1OuterWall.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="305"></p>
    <p>Looking at The Forbidden City from the entrance, doesn't look that 
    spectacular.<br>
    The building you se on this picture, just looks like an ordinary traditional 
    Chinese building.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ForbiddenCity2OuterWall.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="305">I 
    then realize how huge this wall really is, as I walk through it. The 
    building you see on the previous picture, is actually standing on this wall.<br>
    This wall is not something you break through, the first time you try. (Not 
    the following one hundred times either.)<br clear="all">
    <br>

    <p>Walking thru many walls, with important buildings on them, seems to be 
    more of a rule, than an exceptoion here. Is this The Forbidden City? 
    Everything is just built on these big red walls?<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ForbiddenCity5.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="304">Well, 
    here's something different.</p>
    <p>If you think that my &quot;tour&quot; of the city is a bit boring, you should go 
    here yourself, and rent the audio tour. It's Roger Moore giving you a tour 
    via your rented freestyle. I would recommend it, if you choose to go here 
    without a guided tour (as I had last time).<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="ForbiddenCity6.jpg" width="450" height="304" align="left"><br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ForbiddenCity7.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="302">The 
    more I see of The Forbidden City, the larger it becomes for me. There's the 
    Museum of Watches, and some other points of interest.</p>
    <p>The buildings are generally very large here. Compare to the humans 
    walking over by this building.</p>
    <p><br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ForbiddenCity8Stairs.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="658">The 
    stairs that the Emperor was carried over. This was created out of a single 
    &quot;rock&quot;. No room for mistakes here.</p>
    <p>As a member of today's society, I ask my self: Was it really worth it to 
    create this stone for the Emperor to be carried over? He never walked here 
    on foot any way.<br clear="all">

    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ForbiddenCity10GoldenBowl.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="302">This 
    is where the water was stored, incase there was a fire. And as the buildings 
    are of wood, there where some major incidents.</p>
    <p>Every year, the Emperor would add another layer of gold to these very 
    large pots. And they where plenty too.<br>
    When the soldiers came here the first time, they cut much of the gold away, 
    with every mean possible. Greed will do that.</p>
    <p><br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="ForbiddenCity11GoldenLion.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="305">The 
    eternal defender. He always watch over the building behind him, preventing 
    evil people to enter.<br>
    On the opposite side of the door, there's another one of these, but female, 
    and having her paw on on a sphere instead.</p>
