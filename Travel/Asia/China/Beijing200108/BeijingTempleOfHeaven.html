    <p>As I was 
    here a few years earlier, I'm writing some other comments about this city 
    now.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Judging by the look of the entrance to the Temple of Heaven, I can 
    clearly see that this must have belonged to the Emperor.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TempleOfHeaven2.jpg" width="450" height="295" align="left">This 
    was the only place that the Emperor actually had to walk for a distance. The 
    rest of the time, he was carried from place to place. I guess he was walking 
    around in The Forbidden City, but most official places, he was carried.</p>
    <p>From where this picture was shot, only the emperor could walk. The mid 
    &quot;stripe&quot; of marmor was reserved only for him. The rest of the people had to 
    use the other ports. <br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="TempleOfHeaven3.jpg" width="450" height="304" align="left">Imagine 
    you're working here, or just see this place every day. Every day it's 
    closed, and people walk through these gates, like they always do. It's a 
    normal day, and quite boring.</p>
    <p>One day, you are invited to sit on the outside of this path. This day, 
    the center port is open. You feel the excitement rising for this special 
    occasion. You have the feeling in your stomach, just like your first day of 
    school, when you also knew something big was going to happen.<br>
    And then you see the Emperor waking through the gate.<br>
    It's a moment you will never forget.</p>
    <p>And today, hundreds of tourists are waking on the path that was reserved 
    for the Emperor.<br clear="all">
