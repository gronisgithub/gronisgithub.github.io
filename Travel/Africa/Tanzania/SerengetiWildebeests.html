    the protection of the number of animals. So they gather in enormous numbers.<br clear="all">

    can say: You know all these big hordes of Wildebeests that you see on TV. 
    I've seen them in real. They are even more than you see on TV. And even more 
    stupid. If one starts running, the animal behind will also start running, 
    and the animal behind it will also start, and so on. Looks really stupid.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="Wildebeests3.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="323">These 
    animals are walking in line. And one started running for no apparent reason.<br>
    Some gaps where created, and the animals started to run, as the animal in 
    front decided to run in that gap. So a few hundred animals did the same 
    thing, when it was it's turn.</td>
