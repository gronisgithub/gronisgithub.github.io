    first rule you have to learn about Hippos:<br>
    Don't stand between water and a Hippo. As it has no sweat gland on it's 
    skin, there is no way for it to cool down when standing in the sun. It has 
    to go into the water to cool down.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="Hippo2.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="325">Standing 
    in it's way (unintentionally) is something that kills many people every 
    year. Stay away. Stay in the car. Just have a look at it, and enjoy your 
    visit to it's home. Remember, you are intruding on it's home. I guess you 
    would not want a live Hippo in your livingroom?<br clear="all">

    just eating plants, it has enormous tusks, and some fearsome weapons against 
    rivals.</td>
