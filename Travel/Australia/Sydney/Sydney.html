    <img border="0" src="HarborBridge.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="683">When you are at the Opera house, it's a short walk to the Harbor Bridge. The 
    Australians seem to be so proud of it. I can't see the reason. The opera 
    house is to me so much greater.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="OperaHouse.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="301">I was here during their mid winter. 20 degrees and sun. Winter! We are 
    thrilled in Sweden when the temperature finally reaches 20 degrees.<br>
    What you should see in Sydney is the Opera House. This is so huge. You see 
    it in postcards, and on TV, but you really don't grasp the size of it.<br clear="all">

    <br>
    <img border="0" src="WholeOperaHouse.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="287">After 
    that you should continue walking to one of the great gardens they have. It 
    will be worth your while. When you have seen enough green, continue down to 
    Darling Harbor. A fairly modern Harbor, and everyone keeps telling me that I 
    should visit it. I just felt that the Harbor in Keelung, Taiwan, was looking 
    more impressive though. I leave that up to you to decide. If you have the 
    possibility to see it, it's still a sight worth seeing.<br>

    This was the 3rd time I saw Star wars Episode I. The theatre here was one of 
    the worst I've been to. I almost didn't enjoy the movie because of that. The 
    next time I saw Episode I was in <a href="http://www.filmpalatset.se/">
    Filmpalatset</a>, Bromölla, Sweden. This theatre is almost as great as The 
    Emporium in Thailand. This means that I saw Episode I on 3 continents.<br>
    Which other movies did I see in Australia?? None. Why bother?<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="SpecialTrainInSydney.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="303">The 
    quite different type of train.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="BlueMountains1.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="302">Outside Sydney, you can find the great Blue Mountains. Very fresh air to 
    take a walk in. You can also choose how difficult your walk should be 
    (unless you have me as a guide and get lost). This gave me more than just 
    walking straight to our goal. I got to see lots of different nature 
    environment. So if you have a day over in Sydney, try to get to the Blue 
    Mountains, and walk to the Three Sisters. It's not the sisters that are the 
    interesting part, it's the walk.<br clear="all">

    <img border="0" src="BlueMountainsAfterFire.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="668">A few years before I where there, a substantial fire had been sweeping 
    though the mountains. Now nature is recovering. I saw trees and branches 
    that where completely black, but lots of them had green leaves. It's amazing 
    how nature will find a way...<br clear="all">

    The food in Australia is, as its reputation tells, a lot of barbecue. They 
    have developed this to an art form close to perfection. So all of you 
    barbecue fans, go to Australia.</p>
