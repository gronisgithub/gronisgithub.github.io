    Australia,
    Cairns, 1999-09<p>The place to go diving, according to everyone else. They 
    do have great instructors though, and when I was there the weather was 
    pretty rough, so you learn to dive in quite difficult conditions. This gets 
    your diving self esteem to a new level. So, then you know that you will have 
    no trouble diving in places like Thailand (Phuket). In Thailand it's just a 
    walk in the park, compared to diving at the Great Barrier Reef. And over 
    there is more to see under the surface. <br>

    went on a safari, to see some crocodiles and taking a boat trip in the 
    mangrove. If you're interested, then I would recommend it, but don't expect 
    to see any animals, other than the crocodiles.</p>

    There is a Crocodile on the image. Just above &quot;Lew&quot; in the center of the 
    image. Just under the green bushes. Hard to see?<br clear="all">

    don't have any picture of that exact one, but I did actually pet a napoleon 
    fish (seen on the picture). They are very slippery, and now I understand why 
    sharks sometimes loses it's pray. This 1 meter fellow was very friendly, and 
    very curious. Touching a fish in the ocean was very exciting. I am the 
    visitor there, and the fish allowed me to explore it's hospitality. I am 
    very thankful for that. I hope that we can keep the oceans at the state they 
    are today, and not worsen the situation.<br clear="all">

    The people on the picture are the certified rescue-divers and our 
    instructor. Luciano was my diving buddy there, and we got a long very well 
    together. He gave me the confidence I needed to believe in myself. Most of 
    the time on the boat we where all chatting about life and diving. We where 
    doing some &quot;pleasure dives&quot; as well. The morning dive was really great. The 
    sun just came up when we jumped in the water. I also did my first night dive 
    there. This was not my thing. I like to see more nature then what you can 
    see with the light of my flashlight. During the night dive, the napoleon 
    fish followed us. When our light hit another smaller fish, that fish got 
    temporarily blinded by our light. So then the napoleon tried to catch the 
    blinded confused fish. Sometimes it got lucky.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    When we where doing a navigation dive, for the search and rescue, we came 
    across a shark that was staying at the bottom. Very very nice thing to see. 
    It moves without any effort. Needless to say, my heart was working quite 
    hard the first seconds when I realized that I was in the water with a shark. 
    But when I saw that the shark where just watching me with no real interest, 
    I cooled down quite quick, to really enjoy my presence near a live shark. 
    After a moment the shark lost its interest in us, and took off. Also the 
    turtles are gracious animals under water. Well, at least compared their 
    maneuver capability on land that is.<p>
    
    So I think I got so see my share of nice creatures. The boat ride back to 
    shore was by a much smaller boat. Since we had very rough weather a lot of 
    people got seasick. Luckily I was not one of them. The reason could be that 
    I spend some time each year working at an amusement park, on one of the 
    rides. <br>
    <br>
    If you're not going diving, there is Bungee jumping and White water rafting 
    to keep you busy. Rafting is very thrilling for me, and I would like to do 
    it again some time, if the conditions are right. Bungee jumping was not 
    exciting for me. A complete waste of time. No fear, no rush, no excitement. 
    Other than that - there is nothing more to do in Cairns. Unless you want to 
    go on some tours for several days, but to me, this is not in Cairns. </td>
