    You know, the cold place 1000km from the north pole.<br>
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="HotelWindow.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="305">On 
    Svalbard, Longyearbyen is the 'capital'. It's also village (with permanent residents) that is the furthest 
    north in the world. It's not dark for 3 months of the year (24h daylight), 
    and for 3 months there's no sign of the sun anywhere. They have 3 km of road 
    in LongYearByen, so bringing my motorcycle there 
    would be just as sense full as arguing with a cloud.<p>Well, I went to Svalbard to see the polar bear, and a closer look of the 
    arctic landscape. I got to see them both. The landscape is really amazing. 
    The air is cold, fresh and clean. Among the cleanest places on earth. The 
    difference to the air in Bangkok is just as different as the temperature in 
    those places. On a good day it's a few degrees over freezing point.<br>
    For some reason there is not much wind in the air, and when I was there the 
    sun was showing it's face almost all of the time. This combination made 
    summer in the arctic durable. Cold, but durable. 7 layers of clothes on my 
    torso, and 3 layers on my legs. On times where the wind where somewhere 
    else, the sun tried to persuade you to take of your cap. After a while, I 
    couldn't resist, and removed my cap. But after a few minutes, I realized 
    that it was was too cold for me.</p>

    <img border="0" src="ViktorBuynitskiy.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="303">On this ship (Viktor Buynitskiy), I got seasick for the first time in my 
    life. And it was on a day like you see on the brochures. No wind, no waves, 
    just a calm day. Strange, since I did not get seasick on the boats in 
    Thailand and Australia. If you are planning to go here, bring something to 
    cure your cold, since you probably will get one. Sun block is also a 
    necessary thing to bring. And you need sun block factor in the area of 
    30-75. Clear skies, snow and water reflecting the rays, and you are outdoor 
    all the time will call for this.<br>
    I took some 400 pictures during my week there, and here I proudly present 
    the best of them.<br clear="all">
    <br>
    
    <img border="0" src="SvalbardRouteMap.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="531">Here's a picture of the route our group took.</p>
    <p>
    The down side of this trip was that I was not able to see all the nature I 
    wanted. The guides always wanted us to go to settlements, and other historic 
    places. I didn't go to Svalbard to see history. I can watch that on TV.<br>
    <br>
    We where lucky enough to see the polar bear hunting, use the tactics of 
    being quiet (as the surrounding is really quiet here) and sneaking towards 
    its pray down wind. It did not work this time, so he had to walk away 
    hungry. And I can agree with the people saying that the polar bear is 
    constantly walking. It may stop for about 15 seconds, but that's it.<br>
    <br>
    Another great reason to go north, far north, is to see the the arctic 
    landscape and the midnight sun. Ice, Ice, and more ice on the ocean, 
    wherever you look. The water was always calm when we where close to the ice. 
    This gives me a very relaxing feeling. And as the sun was always up, it was 
    hard to know by heart what time it was.<br>
    <br>
    If you are lucky, you will also see some great ice-sculptures that mother 
    nature made just for you to look at. Of course, on this page you can only 
    see some photos, so to really see the magnificent and you need to go there 
    your self. Can you tell me how big these pieces of ice are, just by looking 
    a the photos?<br>
    <br>
    One of my best memory from this trip, is the blue ice. This ice is old. 
    Really old. I read somewhere that this ice can be more than 50.000 years 
    old. If this ice is that old, I have no way of knowing. But this piece of 
    ice has been ice long before some guy in Israel tried to walk on water. And 
    there it was, just melting away, right before my eyes.<br>
    <br>
    As 
    you can see on the map above, we took a tour down to the southern most 
    island of Svalbard. It's known for two things. It's birdlife and the 
    constant fog. It's clearly illustrated on this picture. The density of birds 
    on some places on this island can be really high. I've never seen so many 
    birds in one place before. The guide told us that this is the largest bird 
    cliff on the northern hemisphere. However, I did not realize the density of 
    birds, until I saw it with my own eyes. The birds where sitting so tight on 
    the cliffs, that they barely could move. I could compare it to &quot;bird 
    cities&quot;. </p>
    <p>The rain deer we have in northern Sweden does not look like the one on 
    Svalbard. Yes it has horns, and four legs, but I don't think that this is 
    what you imagine Santa to use to bring you your Christmas presents. All you ever 
    see them do during summer, is eating. Just like the polar bear is walking, 
    the rain deer is eating.<br>
    <br>
    We where extremely lucky to see very many seals close together. I saw hundreds of seals, 
    just relaxing. As they where far from shore, and the ice was just big enough 
    to carry them they didn't seem to worry about polar bears.
    We got really close. I was less than 4 meters away, and some others in our 
    small raft where less than 2 meters away. We where _very_ quiet, and didn't 
    move too fast. The very experienced crew on Viktor Buynitskiy got us this 
    close, and they should get all the credit they can. Our guides does not 
    deserve any credit for this trip, as they where more or less useless.<br>
